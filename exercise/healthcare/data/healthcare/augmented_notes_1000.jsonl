{"note": "A a sixteen year-old girl, presented to our Outpatient department with the complaints of discomfort in the neck and lower back as well as restriction of body movements. She was not able to maintain an erect posture and would tend to fall on either side while standing up from a sitting position. She would keep her head turned to the right and upwards due to the sustained contraction of the neck muscles. There was a sideways bending of the back in the lumbar region. To counter the abnormal positioning of the back and neck, she would keep her limbs in a specific position to allow her body weight to be supported. Due to the restrictions with the body movements at the neck and in the lumbar region, she would require assistance in standing and walking. She would require her parents to help her with daily chores, including all activities of self-care.\nShe had been experiencing these difficulties for the past four months since when she was introduced to olanzapine tablets for the control of her exacerbated mental illness. This was not her first experience with this drug over the past seven years since she had been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder. Her first episode of the affective disorder was that of mania at the age of eleven which was managed with the use of olanzapine tablets in 2.5–10 mg doses per day at different times. The patient developed pain and discomfort in her neck within the second week of being put on tablet olanzapine at a dose of 5 mg per day. This was associated with a sustained and abnormal contraction of the neck muscles that would pull her head to the right in an upward direction. These features had persisted for the first three years of her illness with a varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction which would tend to correlate with the dose of olanzapine. Apart from a brief period of around three weeks when she was given tablet trihexyphenidyl 4 mg per day for rigidity in her upper limbs, she was not prescribed any other psychotropic medication. The rigidity showed good response to this medication which was subsequently"}

The patient was in good state and very active. There was not any health problem in the past except a thoracic trauma at work one year ago. In that time the patient was diagnosed with a simple fracture of the 9th right rib without any other consequences.\nOn the X-ray was seen a shadow in the lower part of the right hemithorax. After that, it was decided to perform a CT-scan of the thorax that revealed a tumor of the thoracic wall in the right hemithorax that measured 8 × 4 cm and had a heterogeneous density inside of it. The tumor had involved and destructed the 9th rib and was lying even in two adjacent intercostal spaces, but without involving the lung and muscular layers. On lung window of the CT-scan were seen micronodular infiltrations of both lungs with diameters up to 5 mm and only one nodule in lower lobe of the right lung with diameter almost 1 cm (). The mediastinum was without enlarged lymph nodes and no other lesion was seen in adjacent organs. The conclusion of the radiologist was that probably this was the case of a malignant tumor of the thoracic wall with secondary lesions in both lungs and a biopsy of the tumor was recommended.\nBecause there was not a correlation between the clinical picture of the patient and the conclusion of the radiology it was decided to perform frozen biopsy of the lesions of the right lung and an excision biopsy of the tumor of the thoracic wall. So, through a small posterior thoracotomy at 7th intercostal space were sampled five nodular lesions from the right lung and a sample from the tumor. None of these samples resulted positive (no malignant cells found) after frozen biopsy. In such conditions was considered as more realistic the option of performing an oncologic resection of the tumor of the thoracic wall. (We resected three ribs where the 8th and"}

Physical examination of the patient revealed severe gait disturbance secondary to hip pain aggravated by hip joint flexion or rotation. The patient had no lifestyle habits or specific comorbidities thought to cause femoral head AVN. An anteroposterior view of the left hip revealed sclerosis and collapse of the femoral head and dysplasia of the hip (). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed an increased amount of joint fluid and bone marrow edema in the left hip, and femoral head necrosis was detected on the contralateral side; however, the patient did not complain of any pain (). The patient underwent THA after being diagnosed with idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head, was discharged in good condition three weeks after the surgery without specific complications, and followed up via regular outpatient visits. The patient complained of pain and limited ROM in the contralateral hip joint and gait disturbance one year after the initial surgery. Her symptoms continued for two months and increased over the following three weeks. Repeat MRI revealed similar findings to those noted previously in the left hip (). A second THA was performed (one year after the first THA of the left hip); the patient was discharged in good condition after the surgery without specific complications and followed up via regular outpatient visits (). At the time of the second surgery, the patient was 7 kg heavier than she was at the time of the first procedure and developed a moderate moon face, signs that were initially overlooked as weight gain. Subsequently, the patient complained of intensifying feelings of helplessness and central obesity and muscle mass reduction in both the upper and lower limbs aggravated over a three-month period of outpatient follow-up after the second surgery.

The patient had a history of left elbow arthrodesis performed for posttraumatic arthritis at the age of 18. On physical examination he was tender at the proximal ulna. He had no active flexion or extension at his elbow, which was fused at 90 degrees but achieved 40 degrees of pronation and 60 degrees of supination. His motor and sensory exam was normal at the hand. Radiographs of the forearm and the elbow revealed an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware and a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture (). A decision was made to treat his ulnar shaft fracture closed in a cast, and he subsequently developed a hypertrophic nonunion. At his clinic visit three months after the fall, surgical options for the ulna nonunion were discussed with the patient. We proceeded with conservative treatment for an additional three months, with worsening motion through the nonunion site. He revealed that he was unhappy with the functional limitations of his elbow arthrodesis and inquired about the possibility of converting it to an arthroplasty. The risks of elbow arthroplasty were discussed with the patient at length. Increasing the functional capacity of his arm was his ultimate goal, and understanding that he faced a likely operation for the ulna nonunion, the patient wished to proceed. Due to the patient's prior surgery and history of trauma, as well as risk of infection, we chose to avoid multiple surgeries and combine the repair of nonunion and the conversion of elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty into one procedure. The stem of the ulnar component would thus act as an intramedullary device.\nIn the operating room the patient was placed in a supine position and a posterior incision centered over the elbow was performed. A prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at his index procedure had to be elevated. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty. A triceps splitting approach to the elbow joint was then performed and multiple buried pins"}

The pain increased with weight-bearing physical activity. The patient reported no history of trauma before the onset of the knee pain. Examination showed severe tenderness over the medial side of the knee with mild effusion and moderate limitation of range of motion. There was no erythema or increased warmth of the knee. MRI of the left knee showed a moderate-sized focal area of marrow edema/contusion involving the medial femoral condyle in mid and anterior parts predominantly along the articular surface. The patient was prescribed diclofenac sodium 50 mg twice daily and was advised to avoid prolonged weight-bearing activities. Over the next few weeks, the pain subsided and resolved. Three months later, the patient developed spontaneous new onset of pain involving the lateral aspect of the same knee. MRI showed bone marrow edema involving the lateral femoral condyle with complete resolution of the bone marrow edema of the medial femoral condyle. He was treated conservatively with NSAIDs and physiotherapy and advised to use cane to minimize weight bearing on the diseased knee. demonstrates MRI of the left knee in September 2016 and three months later.\nIn April 2017, the patient developed gradual pain over the medial side of the right knee with no obvious swelling.

She was unable to walk for the last 4 years with severe weakness and bone pain. She reported that for the last 2 years she was so weak that she could not turn over in bed and this was associated with pain all over her body. Her condition started as a baby as she did not walk till she was 2.5 years old. Then when she started school she stated she could walk but could never run, the family was poor and never sought medical help for her condition. She got married at a young age of 15 and became pregnant soon after that. During her pregnancy she had difficulty in walking and had pain in her legs, she needed assistance to rise from the sitting position and she was told she would need a cesarean section because she had a contracted pelvis, but she went into labor before she was able to have a cesarean section and she delivered vaginally and developed a fracture of the pubic rami during delivery.\nHer condition over the following years worsened and she was having more difficulty in walking and needed assistance in climbing stairs. She went to several orthopedic surgeons and she was diagnosed as osteomalacia and given calcium and vitamin D without any improvement, till she became totally bedridden. At one time she was also given calcitriol in small doses and for short periods of time 0.25 mg daily. She eventually stopped all treatments when she did not see any improvement in her condition.

Examination showed decreased air entry on the left side and a subsequent chest radiograph showed what looked like a consolidation of that lung and air-filled bowel loops inside the chest and a further ultrasound examination also identified intrathoracic ipsilateral kidney. A computed tomography (CT) of her thorax was performed, which confirmed left-sided diaphragmatic defect with large and small bowel and a normal looking, completely intrathoracic, ipsilateral left kidney and adrenal gland. The baby was delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery with no antenatal diagnosis; she had normal Apgar score and did not require any resuscitation.\nThe procedure was performed in left lateral decubitus position. A 5 mm camera port was inserted by open technique in anterior axillary and two 3 mm working ports were inserted under vision on either side of camera port. The examination confirmed the CT findings (\n). The herniated large and small bowel was pushed and reduced into the abdominal cavity through the diaphragmatic defect which then revealed a completely intrathoracic kidney encased in Gerota's fascia (\n).\nThe kidney was then reduced into the abdominal cavity retroperitoneally by pushing it down through the diaphragmatic defect (\n). A primary repair using interrupted nonabsorbable sutures was achieved without tension (\n). Initially the gas pressure during the reduction in hernia contents was kept at 6 mm Hg but was then reduced to 4 mm Hg during closure of the defect. A chest drain was left in situ through the 5 mm port site at the end of procedure as there was violation of the pleura.\nThe baby had uneventful recovery and was extubated within 24 hours and chest drain was removed after 48 hours.

Three months back patient experienced sudden onset pain in her right groin region while walking and the patient was not able to bear weight on her right lower limb. Then patient was walking with support, bearing weight on her left lower limb. In about a week, patient experienced similar pain in her left groin and was not able to bear weight on either lower limb since then and was left bed ridden. Clinical findings were consistent with coxa vara deformity of bilateral hips with a possibility of bilateral non-union of pathological fracture of femur neck. There was no evidence of any endocrine disturbance, or altered pigmentation or precocious puberty.\nOn imaging it was concluded that the patient suffered from polyostotic fibrous dysplasia with bilateral Shepherd’s crook deformity of the proximal femur with bilateral non – union of pathological fracture of neck femur (). Imaging of the other bones showed evidence of the fibrous dysplastic lesions in the shaft of left tibia ( and ).

He has been concerned with having a cancer that would give him only few days to live. At the beginning, the patient was evaluated medically through detailed history and documentation of his symptoms and then a management plan was created accordingly to exclude cancer. Full history, physical examinations, and radiological and pathological investigations were ordered and the results were all negative for cancer. The physician explained the results of the investigations to the patient but he refused them and continued to insist that he had cancer regardless of the results. The patient was then referred to Psychiatry Department to be evaluated but he could not realize that his symptoms might be of a nonorganic cause, either psychological or mental.\nThe patient continued to visit the general hospital, emergency department, and the primary health care in the institution and was still occupied with the idea of cancer presence. Although the patient was seen by many physicians, the patient was always not satisfied with their conclusions. Eventually a physician reported the case to the department of medical eligibility addressing the issue of continuous primary health care center visits with very variable symptoms, nonconclusive diagnosis, and an unconvinced patient. The department of medical eligibility in the hospital administration took a decision to temporarily limit the patient's file to the psychiatry department to drive the patient to visit the psychiatrist to be evaluated psychologically in order to make his file eligible again. The patient was unhappy at the beginning but he had to visit the psychiatrist. So, an appointment with the psychiatrist was booked and a full psychological and social evaluation was performed by taking a thorough history from the patient. This revealed that the patient fit the criteria of the illness anxiety disorder in which he had a minimum of six months of a persistent belief of having a serious disease which he specifically named. Moreover, this persistent occupation with this belief was disabling and limiting him from having"}

Five months after the first operation, she suffered from increased swelling of the lesion. She was seen by another physician, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed []. The physician felt that it was a simple skin lesion that could be completely removed under local anesthesia. She underwent a second surgery and experienced severe hemorrhaging. Later, she was referred to our clinic. Her physical examination revealed a painful mass lesion measuring 5 cm × 4 cm × 4 cm in the left parietal region at the vertex level. She did not have any complaints except for her esthetic problem. The results of her neurological examination were normal. A vascular malformation at the scalp was considered, and a cerebral MR angiography was performed and revealed a vascular mass lesion, which was located in the left parietal region and supplied by the branches of the left external carotid artery for which venous drainage could not be clearly identified []. Therefore, we performed a conventional cerebral angiography and detected AVM in the left parietal region that was supplied via the branches of the left temporalis superficial artery, left meningeal media artery, and right temporalis superficialis artery []. The lesion did not have an intracranial component and had no direct drainage vein into the dural sinuses. The patient was surgically treated under general anesthesia in the supine position, and her head was elevated at a 30° angle. The skin flap was removed with a horseshoe incision considering the vascularization of the scalp. The vascular lesion in the soft tissue was dissected, and the malformation was revealed.

The patient reported that she was born at full term by spontaneous vaginal delivery and no perinatal problems and no notable postnatal illness were reported. However, in the months following birth, the parents observed progressive enlargement of her right cheek and a differing eyelid width. According to the patient, the facial asymmetry had become more marked over the following years but had not increased in the past few years. No other family members were affected. Patient's mother reported a normal pregnancy. The enlargement extended from the midline to the preauricular region and inferiorly to the lower border of mandible []. The skin of the involved right side of the face was normal in appearance with no alteration in thickness. The extraoral examination revealed that the right side of the mandible was larger than the left side. The outer contour of the right ear was slightly larger and had a different shape compared to that of the left side []. The nose was normal with no deviation although the chin was deviated toward the side of her face.

The patient had a colorectal carcinoma treated by rectum and ileum segment resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy four years before. After radiotherapy ureteric strictures developed on both sides and ureteric stents were placed. At the time of admission the urine specimen showed few white and red blood cells and the urine culture was sterile. During the change of the ureteric stents a retrograde pyelography and cystoscopy were performed, showing a mild gross hematuria coming out of the right ureteric orifice but no further pathological findings. After the stent change, first the hematuria cleared but one day later again an episode of gross hematuria with blood clots in the bladder occurred. A transurethral catheter was placed and a multiphase CT of abdomen and pelvis was performed. CT detected no source of bleeding. The gross hematuria cleared again and an ureteroscopy on both ureteric sides were performed with special emphasis on the right ureter. Once again nothing suspicious could be found. Thereafter gross hematuria appeared again with massive hemorrhage and an arteriography was performed (). But once again no underlying reason for the bleeding could be found. Two days later a gross hematuria with massive hemorrhage occurred. The patient became hemodynamically unstable and needed blood transfusion of 6 U. Therefore, the indication for nephrectomy of the suspicious right side was set and performed. During the operation the ureteric stent was removed and at the end of the operation the hematuria stopped. When the patient left the operation room again a massive hemorrhage was identified within the bladder catheter. Again an arteriography was performed. Finally, the region of the fistula was identified at the distal common iliac artery and a stent graft was deployed across the fistula (). A postoperative angiogram showed complete closure of the fistula (). After adequate blood transfusion and fluid replacement the patient made a rapid and unremarkable recovery. Twelve months later the patient is still well and the stent graft remains patent. However, the patient lost his right kidney."}
{"note": "The patient was a healthy 13-year-old female, who suddenly felt abdominal pain. She was taken to another hospital by ambulance, and the enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 5 cm diameter cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail with fluid collection around it (). The CT results indicated her acute abdominal pain was due to the hemoperitoneum caused by rupture of the pancreatic tumor. Because she had no history of blunt abdominal trauma, the tumor was considered to have ruptured spontaneously. The pancreatic tumor was diagnosed as a SPT of the pancreas from the finding on the CT combined with her age and gender. Since the bleeding stopped by conservative therapy, she was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment at three months after the rupture of the tumor. At that time, she had no abdominal symptoms and the tumor was not palpable. The CT at our hospital showed the cystic tumor was 4 cm in diameter, which protruded from pancreatic tail and was distant from the main pancreatic duct, and the fluid around the tumor had disappeared (). From these findings, an elective laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor was proposed. Since there seemed to be no peritoneal dissemination from the result of laparoscopic exploration, laparoscopic enucleation was performed by using five trocars under pneumoperitoneum. The pancreatic parenchyma was divided with the laparoscopic coagulating shears (). Duration of operation was 126 minutes and with little blood loss. Because the content of amylase in the fluid from the drain placed at the cut surface of the pancreas was 9710 IU/L on postoperative day 3, the postoperative pancreatic fistula was confirmed according to the international definition []. However, because the volume of the fluid from drain was very small, the drain was removed on postoperative day 4. Except for the pancreatic fistula of grade A [], the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as SPT of the pancreas. The negative surgical margin and the rupture of the capsule of tumor were verified by microscopic examination (). She survived"}

After initial management, the fracture was fixed with a dynamic condylar screw assembly. After an uneventful postoperative period, the patient was discharged with advice to undergo supervised physiotherapy. 3 months into the postoperative period, the patient reported to our emergency department with pain in the thigh. X rays revealed a fracture above the dynamic condylar screw at the plate bone interface. The patient was admitted and revision surgery with a longer barrel plate performed. The patient followed up for a period of 4 months and was bearing weight when she again had pain in the peri implant area. Radiographs revealed a fracture of the femur at the new peri implant region. The patient's femoral neck radiograph revealed an osteoporosis grading of 3 according to Singh's classification []. Keeping in view the potential morbidity associated with the repeat plating we planned a method that would be less invasive and less destructive to the local fracture environment. The proposed surgery was explained to the patient and her attendants. The ethical board permission was sought and obtained. The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on a fracture table. The screws in the plate were removed percutaneously under image intensifier control to ensure the patency of intramedullary canal leaving the plate insitu to avoid reexposure of the bone surface. The fracture was reduced and fixed with a reamed antegrade intramedullary nail. Anticipating the difficulties in distal locking with an insitu plate an external locking device comprising of a distal full ring and a proximal Italian arch connected by two threaded rods were used. No blood transfusion, bone grafting were used and the mean operating time was 40 minutes.

The initial diagnosis was of acute disc prolapse and he was referred for an urgent neurosurgical opinion. The neurosurgeon concurred that the pain may well have been of neurological origin and arranged an MRI scan. This was reported as showing no evidence of spinal cord pathology. The patient was reassured with the results of the MRI findings and was advised the pain was probably musculoskeletal in origin and should settle. Over the subsequent 6 weeks, the pain persisted and indeed increased in severity. The patient noted claudication-type pain in his right leg after approximately 100 metres. As the pain had not resolved after 6 weeks he revisited his general practitioner. During the subsequent examination the pulses in his right leg were noted to be absent and he was referred for an urgent vascular surgical opinion.\nThe patient was seen the following day in the vascular clinic where a history of severe acute claudication-type pain was noted in the right leg. There was a past medical history of marked hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, for which he took relevant medications, but none of angina, myocardial infarct or valvular heart disease. On clinical examination the heart rate was 68 beats per minute regular. The blood pressure in the right arm 130/70 mmHg was lower than that of the left arm 160/80. Cardiac examination was normal. There was no clinical evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Examination of the limbs revealed that the right lower limb pulses were all absent whilst those of the left leg were present and of good volume. An urgent abdominal ultrasound scan was arranged which demonstrated dissection of the intra-abdominal aorta and a subsequent CT scan (Figures , , ) confirmed that the dissection was a Type A dissection extending from the aortic valve down to the aortic bifurcation. A dissection flap was identified in the ascending aorta and also in the postero-inferior aspect of the descending aorta. Both lumens"}

The initial Rx-ray at admission displayed a femoral neck fracture with dislocation of the femoral head into the pelvis (). The patient also presented macroscopic and laboratory confirmed hematuria. A CT scan was not available at that time, but because of the hematuria we suspected an anterior dislocation of the femoral head. A Foley catheter was introduced into the urinary balder and antibiotics were administrated. Surgery was performed next day in lateral approach of the hip with anterior capsulotomy. The femoral head was not found into the hip but in the pelvis and could not be extracted but only touched by finger through a laceration between the anterior acetabular rim and the decollated labrum, creating a dislocation space similar to the anterior dislocation or the shoulder. However a 50 mm Austin Moore prosthesis was implanted and after the surgery the patient had the femoral head replaced and the fractured femoral head retained as o loose fragment into the pelvis (). The patient was prepared for the next surgery and two days later the urologist extracted the femoral head by a new abdominal approach Gibson with retroperitoneal dissection of the common iliac vessels. The head was placed on the iliopsoas muscle and under the iliac common vessels, and during the procedure no visible injury of the ureter, balder or iliac vessels was found. Soon after removing the abdominal wound drainage the patient experienced pain in the hip, lost mobility and swelling occurred at the hip wound. Several punctures of the hip extracted a large amount of clear liquid which was investigated and was found to have density and elements like urine. A drainage tube was reinserted into the hip wound and the patient underwent repeated urological evaluation by urography and endoscopic techniques.

The tachyardia was repeatedly terminated by intravenous adenosine and verapamil. She was nondiabetic and nonhypertensive. General physical and cardiovascular examination were normal. Her baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) showed left bundle branch block with normal PR interval. The electrocardiogram of tachycardia revealed similar morphology, with the heart rate of 210 beats/min. (). Her transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not show any evidence of structural heart disease. An electrophysiological study was planned with a presumptive diagnosis of AVNRT. Catheter manipulation to obtain His bundle electrogram led to complete heart block because of trauma to right bundle that required temporary right ventricular pacing. No tachycardia could be induced during complete heart block and there was no evidence of accessory pathway. Complete heart block persisted for 3 hours during which she required temporary ventricular pacing support. Patient was discharged after 48 hours with a plan to restudy on recurrence. Within 15 days, she had 3 episode of tachycardia all terminated with intravenous adenosine. After the recurrence of episodes, she was taken up for a restudy with a plan of avoiding His bundle / Right bundle injury and as a part of the same plan to avoid His recording coronary sinus catheter was put from the right internal jugular vein. Three 7 F sheaths were put into right femoral vein and one 6F sheath was put into right internal jugular vein. One catheter was put into high right atrium and another into right ventricular apex carefully avoiding trauma to His bundle. From the internal jugular vein, since the catheter did not follow a normal course, angiogram was done that showed absent right superior vena cava and whole of the jugular system draining into hugely dilated coronary sinus which was missed on transthoracic echocardiogram ().

The insertion of the epidural catheter and operation were finished without any problems and the removal of the epidural catheter was attempted as usual two days after the operation. The epidural catheter broke during its removal. The physician felt resistance when he tried to pull out the catheter and then the catheter was broken 13 cm from the tip. X-rays and a computed tomography scan were subsequently taken (). Although the catheter fragment retaining within the patient was long, a wait-and-see approach was initially employed because there was no neurological deficit. The effusion from the drain hole stopped two days later. No neurological deficit or fever developed after the first evaluation of the images. However, the migration of the catheter was found by imaging studies four weeks after the occurrence of the catheter breakage (). After detailed discussions with the patient and her family it was decided that a surgical removal of the retained catheter should be performed. Then, the patient was referred to our hospital.\nThere was no neurological deficit at the time of admission. A laminectomy was performed at L2-3 seven weeks after the catheter had broken. The patient was placed in the prone position under general anesthesia and then the spinal level that needed to be treated and the retained catheter were identified by using an image intensifier. We exposed the spinal process at L2-3 and the L2 spinal process was split by an air drill.

The initial diagnosis was that of deep venous thrombosis and imaging was undertaken and the patient referred for a vascular opinion.\nOn vascular review, the patient had a pulsatile mass comparable with a popliteal artery aneurysm of 12 cms diameter on the right and 6 cms on the left. His foot was warm and well perfused and his INR was 2.6. He underwent a duplex scan of the lower limb arteries which revealed ectatic iliacs and an abdominal aorta of 3.4 cms in diameter. A further CT arteriogram (fig , ) confirmed that in fact the swelling on the right side was indeed a pseudo aneurysm following rupture with peripheral calcification.\nThe dilemma was therefore a patient with an established pulmonary embolus and a friable clot in the iliac veins, anticoagulation and the treatment of the ruptured aneurysm. Due to lack of expertise we elected to continue with full anticoagulation rather than place an inferior vena caval filter. Operative exploration was performed through a medial approach under full anticoagulation and the right popliteal artery was found to contain a large volume of blood pointing laterally. The popliteal aneurysm was excluded. Duplex examination of the upper and lower limb veins revealed that the veins were of small diameter therefore revascularization of the leg was established by an inlay 8 mm PTFE graft. Due to continuous oozing, the aneurysm sac was packed and the end of the pack brought out laterally. The pack was removed at 48 hours under sedation. The patient made an uneventful recovery. Six weeks later he underwent repair of the left popliteal aneurysm."}
{"note": "On the 24th April 2006 a 9 month old girl was brought to the Emergency Department of a hospital which routinely refers patients to us. She had sustained a dog bite to her face 30 minutes previously. She was seen by the emergency physicians and was found to have received multiple lacerations to her face over the right zygoma, right paranasal area, right cheek, left eye lid, left paranasal area, left lower cheek and over her left body of her mandible. She was fully examined and found to have no wounds elsewhere however due to the circumstances of patient and parental distress, intra-oral examination was not possible. The initial work up did not include radiographic investigations as it was felt by the emergency physicians that only a soft tissue injury was sustained. On the advice of the on-call maxillofacial team she had her facial wounds cleaned with aqueous iodine solution and she was started on an oral course of Co-Amoxiclav and paracetamol. An examination by the ophthalmologist revealed no ocular injury.\nShe was transferred to our unit the following day, fasted in preparation for an examination under general anaesthesia and primary closure of her facial lacerations. During the procedure it was found that she had sustained an open fracture of her left mandible consistent with a dog bite. (fig ). This was treated via a trans-oral approach with a five hole 1.2 mm titanium plate and four 3 mm screws. (fig ). She had her facial laceration copiously irrigated with normal saline and chlorhexidine and primarily closed in with a fine nylon suture. She was discharged home the next day. Seven days later she attended for removal of sutures under a general anaesthetic and examination of her jaw. The facial wounds were healing well and there was no movement at the fracture site. Ten weeks after the first operation she was admitted for removal of her mandibular plate under general anaesthetic. There was good bony union and the plate was removed with no complications (fig ). She will continue to be reviewed in clinic to monitor dent"}

Patient had a past medical history significant for RCC, initially diagnosed at stage II, 11 years ago followed by left nephrectomy. Patient also had metastasis to tail of the pancreas and tip of spleen 6 years ago which was followed by total resection of pancreas and spleen. Patient was followed up for RCC and was last seen 2 years ago when his PET/CT showed slightly increased hypermetabolic area in the biceps femoris muscle which was interpreted as a muscle injury secondary to the rarity of the metastasis to the skeletal muscle from RCC. Patient during the current follow up visit developed a large mass in the posterior side of the thigh which was present for more than a year. As per patient, the mass initially was diagnosed as a blood clot on venous doppler, for which he was treated by his primary care physician with warfarin for more than 6 months. However, the mass progressively increased in size. Patient did not mention of any other constitutional symptoms. On physical examination, a painless, tense mass along the length of biceps femoris muscle measuring more than 25 cm was found in the posterior aspect of the left thigh. The mass was hypervascular and numerous varicosities of different sizes were noticeable on the surface. Patient was imaged using FDG-PET/CT which showed hypermetabolic activity with an uptake value of 3.8 to 4.1 in biceps femoris muscle with multiple serpiginous vessels throughout the tumor, in accordance with a large cavernous hemangioma or an angiosarcoma. This was followed by MRI to better understand the morphology of the tumor, demonstrating a mesenchymal component in an encapsulated mass, raising the possibility of a liposarcoma or an angiosarcoma. A core tissue biopsy was done which demonstrated well defined adipose tissue but because of high suspicion for malignancy, patient underwent preembolization followed by surgical resection. A 28 x 17 x 7 cm resected mass was determined to be metastasis from his primary RCC (Figures , , , , and"}
{"note": "Our patient is a 73-year-old Caucasian female with medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. She had been treated for invasive ductal breast cancer 7 years ago with lumpectomy of the left breast and axillary lymph node dissection. Radiation therapy and seven cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy were administered to her postoperatively, and Anastrozole was prescribed to her for 5 years. She underwent regular annual follow-up for 5 years with chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning with no signs of recurrence or metastatic disease. Seven years after the initial treatment for breast cancer, abdominal CT revealed a solid hepatic lesion at segments VI and VII measuring 7 cm in diameter as well as a 1 cm calcified lesion at the tail of the pancreas (, left). Tumor markers AFP, CA 15–3, CA 19–9, and CEA were all within normal limits and the patient did not have any symptoms or signs of abdominal mass apart from mild tenderness on palpation of the right subcostal region. Moreover, biochemical markers of liver and pancreatic function were normal.\nSubsequently the patient went through oncologic consultation, and both lesions were considered to be resectable, although controversy arose whether they were metastatic or second primary malignancies. CT-guided percutaneous biopsies or laparoscopic biopsies were proposed as minimal invasive methods of diagnosis. The patient rejected both of them due to the risk for possible complications and cancer spillage and decided to undergo laparotomy, open rapid biopsy, and excision of the lesions in one procedure. After accessing the peritoneal cavity through an extended right subcostal incision, we performed hepatic mobilization and exposure of the right hepatic lobe. A solid mass was recognized at hepatic segments VI and VII and rapid biopsy was taken which showed primary HCC. Moreover, after entering the lesser sac, a second rapid biopsy was taken from the lesion at the pancreatic tail which showed chronic fibrosis without elements of malignancy (). We decided to perform resection of hepatic segments VI and VII since intraoperative hepatic ultrasound also confirmed that the mass was resectable with safe oncologic margins. Hepatic segmentectomy was achieved"}

He had initially developed sudden weakness and difficulty using his right upper extremity at the age of 16 years. He eventually had to learn to write using his left hand because of the severity of his weakness. His symptoms progressed over several years, eventually developing into severe symmetrical upper extremity weakness and atrophy in his distal muscles. His lower extremities were spared. Our patient stated he was diagnosed with a type of muscular dystrophy in the US when he was 25 years old. After receiving this diagnosis, he subsequently had a muscle biopsy in Mexico that reportedly confirmed his diagnosis. He had no family members with muscular dystrophy or any other neuromuscular conditions. His symptoms reached their plateau at this time. Because of the stability of his symptoms and his understanding of the disease course, our patient did not seek any further medical care for over 20 years. Upon returning to the US, he was seen by a primary care physician and referred for neurological examination to establish care as well as evaluate the worsening of previously stable chronic symptoms.\nOn presentation, our patient reported a few months of clinical deterioration, particularly recent left upper arm intermittent mild pressure pain. Our patient grew concerned when he noticed increased difficulty performing fine motor tasks with his left hand. In addition, he was experiencing recurrent intermittent episodes of dysphagia while eating solid foods. Our patient denied ever having any previous bulbar symptoms prior to his recent clinical deterioration.\nA clinical examination demonstrated that our patient was thin with significant bilateral upper extremity muscle atrophy and associated weakness. He had severe asymmetric focal segmental atrophy of his bilateral forearm flexor and extensor muscle groups, with preserved and prominent bilateral brachioradialis muscles (Figure ). He had corresponding severe weakness in his upper extremities as measured using the Medical Research Council Scale, with 4-/5 to 5/5 proximal strength and as low as 1/5 strength in his distal muscles.

Her initial system included a Medtronic 4504 passive fixation atrial lead and a Medtronic 4004 passive fixation ventricular lead. She subsequently underwent replacement of her pulse generator in 1998 and insertion of a new Medtronic 5568 active fixation atrial lead and a Medtronic 4068 ventricular leads in August 2003 due to lead failure. She underwent a subsequent generator change in June 2011. The original atrial and ventricular leads were abandoned when the new leads were added in 2003. All procedures had been undertaken at a referring institution and she had not had any prior open-heart surgical procedures. The patient presented at her home hospital with a swollen and erythematous pacemaker pocket in February 2014. Blood cultures did not grow any bacterial or fungal organisms. A trans-esophageal echocardiogram was performed to assess for vegetations on the leads. No vegetations were identified, but there was suspicion that one her atrial lead was extravascular. She underwent chest computerized tomographic imaging and this study revealed that one of her right atrial lead tips was approximately 2 cm within the pericardial space (Figure ). The patient was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone based on a diagnosis of suspected pacemaker pocket infection. She underwent pacemaker pocket exploration and debridement, but extraction was not undertaken due to the increased risks involved with the lead being extra-vascular. No organism was identified from samples of fluid cultured during that initial debridement procedure. Despite that debridement procedure and prolonged antibiotics there was clinical recurrence of the infection and the patient was subsequently transferred to our center for complex lead extraction.\nTo minimize the risk of vascular disruption and tamponade given the chronic right atrial lead perforation, a combined transvenous and open surgical extraction approach was undertaken. Using a dedicated hybrid operating theatre with cardiopulmonary bypass support if necessary, midline sternotomy was performed. Dense adhesions were found within the pericardial space consistent with likely prior pericarditis. Given the location of the RA lead, care was taken to leave the right atrial dissection"}
{"note": "We report the case of a 59-year-old man with hypertension and dyslipidemia, both of which were being treated by his primary physician. The patient suffered a traumatic lumbar fracture in 2013 owing to a fall and underwent surgery. Computed tomography (CT) scans performed at the time were focused on the lumbar spine, so other organs were barely included in the image range and no contrast medium was used. However, when carefully observed retrospectively, the CT scan showed a partial inward deviation of the intimal calcification of the abdominal aorta, suggesting a localized dissection of the abdominal aorta (). However, there was no mention of localized aortic dissection, because the dissection was fairly localized and did not show any abnormal findings, such as aneurysm formation. In addition, the adventitia causing the aortic dissection was also calcified. The findings suggested a chronic aortic dissection that occurred even before the trauma, rather than an acute aortic dissection that occurred at the time of the trauma.\nIn March 2020, the patient was admitted to the emergency department of a nearby general hospital for vomiting. He had no abdominal pain and was subsequently diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis and prescribed oral medication. On physical examination, palpation of the abdomen revealed a pulsating mass, and the patient subsequently consulted his family doctor. After abdominal ultrasound examination, the patient's doctor diagnosed him with an AAA. He subsequently referred the patient to another hospital for a contrast CT scan and a full workup of the AAA. After the enhanced CT scan, the patient was referred to our hospital, where we determined that urgent treatment was necessary owing to the irregular nature of the aneurysm.\nAlthough he did not have any findings suggestive of an infectious disease such as fever or pain, we first considered the possibility of an infectious aortic aneurysm because it was an irregular aneurysm. Upon examination, a pulsating abdominal mass was found, but without tenderness at the site. We conducted a screening test to locate the source of infection. Furthermore, a blood culture was performed, and the results were negative. An oral examination"}

Her mother also reported that her daughter had shown an asymptomatic swelling on the right side of her face since birth. The patient had undergone examination of this condition at 8 months of age. There was history of a gradual increase in the extent of the swelling with age, and the asymmetry of the face persisted. The child was born at full term with normal delivery and there was no history of consanguineous marriage in the family. The child was of normal build and intelligence. There was no familial history of such complaints in the family and serum chemistry revealed no abnormalities.\nThe swelling over the face extended from the zygomatic arch up to the lower border of the mandible on the right side. It was diffuse and had a sponge-like consistency. It was large enough to cause obliteration of the nasolabial fold and the right corner of the mouth seemed to be drooping. No other physical abnormality was noted ().\nIntraoral examination revealed that the cause of pain was the carious right mandibular deciduous second molar. It was also noticed that premature eruption of the permanent mandibular incisors and first molar, and of the maxillary molar was found on the right side. The tongue was also hypertrophic on the right side with noticeably enlarged papillae. The buccal mucosa and gingiva appeared normal ().\nPanoramic radiograph showed that the right mandibular body and ramus were asymmetrically large in size. There was accelerated development of the maxilla and mandible on the right with advanced eruption of the teeth as compared to the left. Radiographic analysis also revealed that all of the teeth on the right side had accelerated root formation relative to their counterparts on the left side.

The patient had given birth to a baby weighing 3500 grams via spontaneous vaginal delivery at 39 weeks of gestation and she experienced heavy bleeding at day 6 after birth. The patient did not respond to medical therapies and conventional methods and underwent hysterectomy due to impaired hemodynamics caused by uncontrolled bleeding. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3 with full recovery. The patient experienced active vaginal bleeding on postoperative day 10 and underwent cuff repair through the vaginal route after exploration. Possible bleeding foci that were inspected during exploration were sutured and then the patient was discharged with full recovery. However, the patient experienced recurrent abundant bleeding on postoperative day 20 for which she was hospitalized and underwent bilateral hypogastric artery ligation. The patient experienced another episode of abundant bleeding on day 7 after the hypogastric artery ligation and she was then referred to our clinic. The patient’s hemodynamics was stable on initial examination. Laboratory parameters were normal. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed normal ovaries and no fluid in the abdominal cavity. A vaginal examination revealed no bleeding. The patient experienced heavy bleeding on day 3 after admission to our clinic and she also had impairment in her hemodynamics. Her hemoglobin was 4.8 g/dL and the patient was administered 4 units of erythrocyte suspension. The patient underwent emergency surgery, but no active bleeding focus was detected. A consultation with a radiologist was performed because no bleeding focus was detected intraoperatively, and the patient underwent computed tomography (CT) with contrast enhancement. The CT scans showed findings suggestive of aneurysmal filling in the pelvic area (). The patient had ongoing bleeding and she underwent angiography in the interventional radiology clinic. Initial angiography revealed an arteriovenous fistula and aneurysm filling from the right internal iliac artery (). The artery fistula was closed with a coil. The right internal iliac artery was totally obstructed by the coil, causing intermittent bleeding after partial intraoperative ligation."}
{"note": "Our patient, an eight-year-old girl, presented to our clinic, with severe swelling and facial asymmetry on the right mandibular molar region. We were informed that the patient developed the swelling as a result of an infection three months previously. The patient had been treated with antibiotics, but as that treatment had not proved successful, she was referred to our clinic. In addition, a passed or congenital disease was not specified in the patient's medical history. Clinical examination revealed severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation and submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region. The patient's skin was of normal color and appearance. In the oral examination, the right mandibular first molar tooth was found to have a deep caries cavity and to not be mobile. The other parts of the oral mucosa were normal. The radiographic examination revealed a deep caries cavity and a radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. There was also a lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible as well as at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus, showing focal new bone formation (). When the axial and cross sections were evaluated during the examination with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a tunnel-like defect was identified in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, starting from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. Bone deposition at the radiolucent area in the center was observed at the lower edge of the mandible as well as the vestibule surface in this region (). When all these findings were evaluated, it was concluded that the pathologic lesion was Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth. In this case, endodontic treatment was considered primarily to retain the infected tooth in the mouth.

For her current episode she was in contact with the local team for the last few years and had presented with moderate to severe depression that needed regular follow up and review of her medication. She also had two inpatient hospital admissions to the psychiatric unit after attempting suicide on two occasions during this episode. During her latest admission, she was treated with different antidepressants and anxiolytics but without any major benefit. Because of the poor control of symptoms of depression, Lamotrigine was added to her other medications (Sertaline and Buspirone which she had been taking for many months). She was started on lamotrigine 25 mg daily which was gradually increased to 50 mg twice daily over the next 2 weeks. Her anxiety and depressive symptoms showed significant improvement on this combination and she started feeling almost back to her normal self. She was continued on this treatment & was discharged from the psychiatric inpatient unit on a combination of Lamotrigine 50mg twice a day, Sertaline 150 mg daily and Buspirone 5mg twice daily. At her weekly follow up, she continued showing improvement in her mental state and the treating team was very satisfied with her response to treatment.\nAbout 16 days following hospital discharge she developed conjunctivitis and over the next 3-4 days, developed swelling of the face and lips. She also developed erosion of the mucous membrane inside her mouth & erythematous papules and bullous eruptions over her body that were particularly bad on the palms of her hands and soles of her feet where she developed detachment of the epidermis.

At clinical examination, both of her eyes were found to have full vision, and also microscopic fundus examinations revealed no pathological conditions. The patient gave a history of a prior application to an outer medical center with the same complaint, and there she had been diagnosed with a left ICA occlusion, following Doppler US and angiographic examinations. The patient applied to our department with the demand of an extracranial carotid Doppler US examination. At Doppler US, the right CCA diameter was found to be 8 mm, whereas the left one came out to be 4 mm (Figures and ). The right CCA bifurcation and the ICA and ECA were found to be normal. At the left side, spectral data for the ECA () and the particular branching which demonstrates that the vessel is ECA indeed were present, whereas there was no Doppler signal and gray-scale findings for the ICA (). Because the left CCA was hypoplastic and there were no findings of atherosclerotic plaques in other arterial segments; it was thought that the left ICA might not be suffering an occlusion at all, but instead it might well be agenetic. Based on the presumption of an ICA agenesis, a computed tomographic (CT) examination of the skull base was performed. CT images revealed a normally appearing right carotid canal but no clear image of the left one (). Then, the previous angiographic images of the patient were reevaluated, and it was then recognized that the left ECA and its branches were well visible, while the left ICA and its branches did not show any filling with contrast (). It was also noted that the filling of the left anterior and medial cerebral arteries was sustained by the patent anterior communicating artery following the injection of contrast into the right carotid artery () and also via the posterior communicating artery following the injection of the vertebrobasilary system ().

{"note": "A 66-year-old man presented to emergency department with an anterior shoulder dislocation () after a ski fall without loss of consciousness. At the initial management, the patient did not show any neurological dysfunction or pulse deficit. The first reduction attempts were unsuccessful and the patient was put under general anesthesia before trying again. During the new attempt to reduce the shoulder dislocation, we observed the occurrence of a hematoma in the deltopectoral region (). At the same time, loss of palpable peripheral pulse and upper limb ischemia appeared. A CT scan was performed and showed a compressive hematoma in the axillary region, a disruption of the axillary artery flow, and a bilateral pulmonary embolism (previously unknown). The patient was transferred to a university hospital to be supported by vascular and trauma surgeons. The patient was still under general anesthesia. The dislocation was successfully reduced in the operating room. Upper limb ischemia with persistent pulseless and cold arm led to an emergency vascular management. The humeral artery was dissected through the brachial tunnel and a thromboembolectomy was done. An arteriography was performed due to the persistence of pulsatile hematoma, which revealed a disruption of the axillary artery with extravasation of contrast near the humeral head (). An angioplasty balloon was introduced to control the proximal bleeding. After the introduction of the occlusion balloon, an incision was performed at the pectoralis major muscle and the hematoma was decompressed. The artery was deteriorated over about 1 cm and an end-to-end anastomosis was performed. The bilateral pulmonary embolism was probably due to the compression of the axillary vein during the shoulder dislocation. Nevertheless, no examination has confirmed this hypothesis. The patient received an intravenous anticoagulant therapy by heparin and then by an oral anticoagulant. Postoperatively, Doppler ultrasound showed a good morphologic and hemodynamic result. Concerning the functional outcome, the patient did not have neurological or vascular complications in the postoperative period.

He was otherwise well, though was currently unable to perform any activities that involved prolonged weight bearing and found it increasingly difficult to continue his occupation within allied health care.\nThe patient noted an initial diagnosis of OCD at age 13. This was appropriately treated conservatively with a period of reduced load and protected weight bearing. He was later able to return to sport - which included Australian Rules football.\nDue to recurrence of pain he underwent arthroscopic examination at age 14. Arthroscopic probing of the OCD lesion indicated that it was stable and conservative management and further unloading was pursued. The patient failed conservative management and 1 year later underwent a repeat arthroscopy at which time an unstable 3 cm × 3 cm lesion involving his medial femoral condyle was removed. It was felt that as the fragment had little subchondral bone that direct repair was not achievable. A further arthroscopy was performed 8 months later and a chondral biopsy was taken for later autologous chondrocyte transplantation. At the time it was noted that no healing had occurred at the site of the defect.\nTwo months later, the treating surgeon, using a lateral arthrotomy approach, patched the defect using a matrix induced autologous chondrocyte implant (MACI). The patch was fixed in place using fibrin glue. One year later, and due to persistent discomfort and swelling of the knee, the patient underwent a further arthroscopy. It was noted that the outer rim of the MACI patch had incorporated well, yet an inner area of 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm had failed to fill completely.\nAt age 23 and due to troubling discomfort and mechanical features of instability the patient underwent another arthroscopy.

The ophthalmologic examination showed a bilateral constriction of the visual field and a slight reduction in the visual acuity on the right side. A magnetic resonance of the brain and a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) disclosed a giant partially thrombosed aneurysm of the ICA on the right side (). Although there is no randomized evidence showing that the FDs are superior to the conventional treatment options, the FD option was considered for the following reasons: the paraclinoid ICA represents one of the best targets for such devices [], there were no anatomical limitations to a correct deployment, and, by inducing aneurysm shrinkage, it might have been possible to relieve the mass effect on the optic pathways []. The ophthalmic aneurysm was initially loosely coiled and then a Pipeline FD was placed in the parent artery across the aneurysm neck (). The FD was well deployed and the landing zone extended from the supraclinoid ICA to the cavernous ICA (). There was only a mild focal narrowing at the level of the distal ring where the ICA was compressed by the bulk of the aneurysms against the clinoid process (). The visual acuity deteriorated acutely on both sides despite corticosteroids. The patient was discharged home after 7 days with double antiplatelet medication (75 mg of clopidogrel and 100 mg of aspirin per day). Three months after the procedure, in concomitance with the cessation of the clopidogrel, she acutely developed a hemiparesis on the left side that lasted 48 hours.

The patient had since been free of tumour recurrence until presentation.\nA recent chest X-ray showed a suspicious shadow in the right lower lobe of the lung . Two computer tomography examinations of the chest (fig ) were performed but could not conclusively rule out the possibility of metastasis. It was diagnosed initially as an inflammatory process of the lung. When the shadow failed to change with time further investigations were ordered. This was when a tumour in the right atrium was discovered which was neither haemodynamically nor clinically relevant. Magnetic resonance imaging of the chest showed a spherical tumour (28 × 27 × 20 mm) attached to the wall of the right atrium. The T1 weighted image revealed homogenous signal intensity as well as a loss of signal due to fat tissue. The tumour didn't show any signs of contrast medium uptake so that the diagnosis of a benign lipoma was made preoperatively. Transthoracic echocardiography excluded heart valve dysfunction and confirmed the presence of a mass in the right atrium.\nOn account of the above-mentioned criteria and of the absence of metastasis of the melanoma excision of the lipoma as well as a biopsy of the mass in the right lower lobe was planned. The patient was clinically stable. Heart rate, blood pressure, ECG and lab results were normal with the exception of urea & electrolytes. After careful preparations the lipoma excision was carried out through incision of the right atrium while the patient was supported by cardiopulmonary bypass. The tumour was walnut-sized, yellow, had a smooth surface"}

The patient had been treated with antibiotics, but as that treatment had not proved successful, she was referred to our clinic. In addition, a passed or congenital disease was not specified in the patient's medical history. Clinical examination revealed severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation and submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region. The patient's skin was of normal color and appearance. In the oral examination, the right mandibular first molar tooth was found to have a deep caries cavity and to not be mobile. The other parts of the oral mucosa were normal. The radiographic examination revealed a deep caries cavity and a radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. There was also a lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible as well as at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus, showing focal new bone formation (). When the axial and cross sections were evaluated during the examination with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a tunnel-like defect was identified in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, starting from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth.

The condition has started as an erythematous patch and has developed over a period of 2 years as a fistula to the current size. On palpation, margins were non tender. All surrounding tissues appeared normal in color and texture. When the patient was asked to gargle water, it escaped through his nose. The maxillary occlusal radiograph showed the loss of bone from mid palate region []. Patient's medical history was uneventful, and blood investigations were within normal limits. Serological investigations also showed a negative report for venereal diseases. The patient was advised to discontinue the denture immediately, and the surgery was planned by preferring the palatal rotational flap.\nThe surgical closure of palatal fistula planned under general anesthesia. It was induced by nasotracheal intubation. Patient placed in the supine position and neck extension achieved by keeping a pillow under the shoulder. Local anesthesia with adrenaline was injected around the lesion for hemostasis. The margins of the fistula were excised to remove the epithelial lining. A palatal flap design was planned based upon the course of the greater palatine artery and marked according to the site and size of the defect []. A partial thickness flap was raised and rotated laterally to cover the defect []. The flap was then secured in its new place using 3–0 black silk sutures [].

Clinical examination revealed that the superior limb was articulating with the shoulder joint, and the inferior limb laterally attached to the chest wall. Both these limbs on the right side were hypoplastic compared to the left upper limb. The superior limb was approximately 7 cm shorter than the opposite limb (normal side), the superior limb being 33 cm in length from the shoulder joint while the inferior limb was 18 cm from the attachment with the chest wall. The skin over the forearm on the superior limb was shiny and atrophic with very little soft tissue mass compared with the inferior limb which was bulkier with normal-appearing skin. The superior limb was articulating with the torso via a normal shoulder joint. The scapula was small compared to that on the opposite side. The inferior limb was attached to the lateral thoracic wall by soft tissue at the level of the 4th intercostal space. The superior limb had a humerus, a single bone at the forearm level, and a duplicated thumb with an index finger. There was synostosis at the elbow joint and the wrist joint was stable. All fingers showed symphalyngism; the middle ray including the 3rd metacarpal was absent. The inferior limb had two fingers and a single bone with which it was attached to the chest wall. Clinically, the superior limb presented a picture of an ulnar hypoplastic hand where there was a stable wrist joint and a fused elbow joint. The inferior limb presented like a radial club hand with instability of the wrist joint.

A 27 year old female runner was initially part of an experimental study documenting the muscle onset timing of the posterior leg and trunk muscles during the prone leg extension. At the time of the study the participant had no leg or spine injuries. The participant was part of the asymptomatic control group. Five months after the completion of the study this participant suffered an inversion right ankle sprain during a rainstorm while leaping into a camping tent filled with children. At 2 and 8 weeks post ankle sprain the PLE extension test was performed while recording the posterior muscle activation EMG to determine if an ankle injury influences the timing of muscle activation during the PLE as compared with an injury-free PLE onset timing pattern.\nTwenty seven year old female distance runner (height – 167 cm, weight -58 kg) suffered a right ankle inversion sprain. X rays revealed no fractures. Informed consent to participate in this study was received from the subject. In the initial study the participant read and signed an information and consent form that was approved by the Research Ethics Board of CMCC. For the second half of the study the subject was notified of the risks and benefits of the study which complied with the World Medical Association declaration of Helsinki on the ethical conduct of research using human participants within a private practice and agreed to have her results published.\nNo passive therapy was received by the participant.

{"note": "A 11 years old male was referred to the emergency department of Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital due to a slight periodontal bleeding of 5 days of evolution. An orthopantomography was performed to focus the diagnosis. The OPG evidenced a dubious periapical image compatible with a small cyst of dental origin. Hence, the doctors of the emergency service decided to contact with the maxillofacial surgery department. A new clinical examination evidenced a spontaneous alveolar bleeding and high mobility of the first and second molars of the fourth mandibular quadrant. The patient denied cervicofacial trauma or pathologies of the coagulation system. Thus, a CT scan of the cervicofacial area was performed to reach a diagnosis. Surprisingly, this test evidenced a large high-flow intraosseous arteriovenous malformation extending from the right mandibular body to the homolateral pterygoid region and the infratemporal fossa (Fig. ). Moreover, a selective arteriography and a MRI of head and neck were also carried out to identify the limits of the malformation and the key vessel (Fig. ). Considering these findings, we contacted with the interventional radiology unit of the Hospital in order to plan a combined approach. However, after a careful analysis we decided to treat the patient only with an endovascular approach. Specifically, a very large drainage vein was identified with the radiological tests. Hence, we hypothesized that the embolization of this vein and the selective embolization of the main arterial vessels might be enough to treat the pathology. Thus, under general anesthesia and femoral approach, the embolization of the main drainage vein and of the most accessible arteries was carried out. The patient was maintained intubated and sedated for 24 hours and he was extubated when the bleeding had completely stopped. He was discharged from the hospital 7 days after the procedure. In fact, a control arteriography performed 5 day after embolization showed a significant reduction of the size of the lesion. A MRI performed three months after the procedure evidenced the complete regression of the lesion. Furthermore, in a new control 18 month after the patient has no clinical"}
{"note": "A 64-year-old gentleman with a post radiation recurrent squamous carcinoma of the left lower alveolus was posted for composite resection and reconstruction with fibula free flap by simultaneous two team approach. The left fibula was selected and after flap harvest, the left neck vessels (superior thyroid and facial) were assessed for the volume and character of the flow and were found to be good. The bone defect was extending from midline anteriorly to proximal ramus posteriorly and the soft-tissue defect was confined to the oral cavity []. The flap was designed in a manner so that the superior thyroid vessels were to be used as donor vessels as they were away from the previous zone of irradiation and the blood flow was also good after dissecting them and dividing to look for the volume and adequacy of blood flow. After osteotomy and preliminary intra oral in setting of the skin paddle, and during the time of anastomosis, it was found that the flow in the superior thyroid artery was inadequate after initial good flow. Routine measures such as application of warm saline, xylocaine solution and later papaverine did not improve the flow and in such a situation, the options available were\nTo open the right neck and use vessels from that side either directly or with a vein graft To use a vein graft and anastomose with the facial artery on the same (left) side as the flow in this vessel was good To use the distal end of the flap pedicle vessels for anastomosis with left facial artery, so as to establish the vascular flow in a retrograde manner. This was because the clipped distal ends of the peroneal pedicle vessels were near to the left facial artery.\nBefore exploring the opposite neck or harvesting a vein graft, a decision was made to attempt retrograde vascularisation of the flap via the distal end of the peroneal vessels. First, the arterial anastomosis was completed between the distal end of the peroneal artery and left facial artery (end-to-end) and the flow was checked. The arterial flow"}

The symptom was constant and worsened with menstruation, standing or walking for more than 30 min. The pain was relieved by elevating the leg in the sitting position or massaging the calf muscles. The pain was not associated with any progressive neurologic symptoms or signs. She reported that none of the medications she had tried provided any significant pain relief. Intramuscular electrical stimulation for 4 months and repeated muscle injections with lidocaine were also ineffective. Alternative treatments including acupuncture and Korean herbal medications had been tried many times without much success.\nThe patient's pain drawing showed a pain pattern limited to the left calf, especially in the medial side, which indicated a referred pain pattern of medial gastrocnemius or soleus muscle (). Physical examination revealed severe tenderness on the medial side of the left calf muscles. Signs of calf swelling were equivocal. Deep tendon reflexes were normal in both sides. Muscle strength of both lower extremities was normal. Sensation in both lower extremities was intact. The straight leg raising test was normal. Conventional radiography of the left leg showed several mottled calcifications within the muscles but did not reveal erosions of tibia or fibula (). To rule out a possible vascular deformity, femoral angiography was performed and a hemangioma was suggested in the left calf (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left lower extremity was performed for further evaluation of these abnormalities and showed an enhancing soft-tissue mass in the medial aspect of the soleus muscle ().\nThe patient was referred to an orthopedic surgeon and underwent excisional biopsy.

He had sharp pain initially when he first developed the abnormality but had been asymptomatic ever since. He did not recall any inciting factors. He was concerned that a previously repaired right inguinal hernia had recurred from its original tissue repair in 1977. Details of the original right inguinal hernia repair were unknown to the patient, other than no implantation of mesh occurred. On physical examination, a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to elucidate the cause of the mass in his groin (Figs. , , and ). The imaging was relevant for a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 109/L. The patient elected to proceed with surgical intervention for hernia repair.\nThe patient presented to the hospital setting for his elective right inguinal hernia repair. A classic oblique incision was made in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. The external oblique aponeurosis was opened and the hernia isolated and examined. The hernia was noted to be comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum that had a chronic, scarred appearance. The base of the appendix could be seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity. Initially, there was no indication to perform an appendectomy at the time of the procedure if the appendix could be successfully reduced into the abdominal cavity. However, the chronic appearing adhesions in the area prevented this step. In order to reduce the appendix at that point, a relaxing incision was then made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum entered"}

She had no other obvious sequelae from the subarachnoid hemorrhage and her medical condition was quite stable with the shunt. Her breasts were large and drooping (), and left nipple areola sparing mastectomy was scheduled. A preoperative computed tomography scan showed the shunt tube, which pierced the intervertebral lumbar and traveled through the subcutaneous layer of the left trunk () and entered into the abdominal cavity from the outer edge of the left rectus abdominal muscle ().\nIn the selection of the reconstruction method, we thought that abdominal flap would be suitable because implant reconstruction would not achieve morphologically favorable results and because a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap would not have sufficient volume. However, it was considered that the shunt tube might cause difficulty in the elevation of the flaps.\nWe consulted brain surgeons on the feasibility of the abdominal flap operation and decided to withdraw the tube from the abdominal cavity once, when the flap was elevated, and to reinsert it upon the closure of the donor site. The patient consented to our preoperative explanation of the procedure and indicated that she desired to undergo DIEP flap reconstruction.\nShe underwent nipple areola sparing mastectomy of the left breast and immediate DIEP flap reconstruction. In the elevation of the flap, a skin incision was first made around the whole circumference of the flap and dissection was carried down to the muscle fascia.

A few months after the injury, he noticed a small growth on the left side of the upper gums that progressively increased slowly to the present size. There was a sudden surge in growth 20 days before presentation to our department after the patient removed a tooth fragment sticking to the growth. There was a gross asymmetry of face caused by the diffuse swelling involving the lower two-third of the left side of the face. Superoinferiorly, it extended from the infraorbital region to the lower border of the mandible and the anteroposterior extent was from the midline to the left preauricular region.

Periosteum was seen exposed in lower third of tibia and wound was badly contaminated. Radiographs of the leg showed a distal third tibia fracture with a segmental piece of tibia which was further comminuted. The fibula fracture was at the same level as tibia and was short oblique fracture. Patient presented immediately after the injury and debridement was done within 2 hours of injury. A thorough wash was given with debridement of all dead and devitalized tissue. Fracture was fixed using a biplanar external fixator (). Wound dressing was done regularly and intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics were given. Two further debridements were needed and at 4 weeks the wound was healthy enough to perform a cross leg flap. At 3 weeks post flap surgery, the external fixator was removed due to multiple pin track infections and the limb was immobilized in a long leg cast. At 3 and half months post injury the wound was healthy.

{"note": "A 71-year old man was referred to our clinic for the sudden onset back pain with weakness in both legs and sensory change. The pain was located at mid thoracic area, and was positively related to motion. It started 5 days prior to the visit and the neurologic changes occurred the following day. Neurologic examination revealed grade IV motor power on both legs and hypoesthesia was present below the level of the xiphoid process. The patient was able to walk with the aid of a cane. He had been taking anti-arrhythmic medications for a year, and had no other past medical history.\nPlain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken from the other hospital revealed a T8 acute compression fracture with cord compression (). Under an impression of the T8 pathologic fracture, we ran a series of tests to find the primary origin of the spinal metastasis. All laboratory tests including tumor markers were within normal limits. Chest and abdominal computed tomography scans did not show any mass lesions in solid organs. We discussed the plan for diagnosis with oncologists. Since the patient presented with neurologic symptoms in both lower extremities, we came to an agreement that planning an early spine surgery of T8 decompression and stabilization and making the pathologic diagnosis through tumor tissue removed during the surgery would be reasonable. Further systemic work ups such as whole body positron emission tomography was planned after confirmation of the pathologic diagnosis. No steroid therapy was performed during the preoperative period.\nA spinal embolization was performed prior to the operation. As a small size of the ASA was visualized on the left T8 segmental artery angiography (), only the right T8 segmental artery was embolized. On the following day, we carried out a total laminectomy of T8 and pedicle screw fixation from T6 to T10. Tumors located at the ventral side of the dura sac were partially removed to achieve circumferential decompression of the spinal cord. For this procedure, we resected both T8 roots. The operation was uneventful. No significant changes were observed on neurophysiologic intraoperative"}

Routine chemistry and tumor marker levels (CA 19-9, CEA, CA 125) were all within normal limits. Abdominal CT scan and EUS showed about 5×4 cm sized, slightly septated cystic tumor between the body and tail of the pancreas (). There was no mural nodule, no calcification, and no eccentrically located mass within the cystic area. The benign mucinous cystic tumor of the pancreas was the most favorable preoperative diagnosis. The operation sequence was similar to usual laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy except trocar placement (). The robotic camera arm and other three instrument arms were then connected to their respective ports. At this point, the surgeon sat at the surgical console located about 3 m from the operating table. The assistant surgeon was positioned on the patient's left side for temporary use of laparoscopic instruments through Port 4. In spite of our previous experiences of robot surgical system, the cystic tumor and the remaining splenic vessels were so closely adherent that bleeding was frequently encountered, and most operation time was spent for this process. The risk of cyst rupture was also considered when we tried to separate and divide the small splenic vessels from pancreatic cyst (). Therefore, concomitant segmental resection of splenic vessels was thought to be necessary for spleen preservation. Total operation took about 480 minutes, and about 800 mL of blood loss was noted without blood transfusion. The specimen was delivered through the umbilical port site with small vertical incision after putting into the plastic bag. The patient recovered without complication. She returned to an oral diet on the postoperative second day. After the drain was removed, she was discharged on the fifth day post-operation. The final pathologic examination revealed that the tumor was benign mucinous cystic neoplasm without any characteristics of malignant potential (). A color doppler ultrasound scan obtained 14 days after surgery showed no evidence of splenic infarction and well preserved blood flow within the spleen without definitive peripancreatic fluid collection ("}

She denied angina, palpitations, syncope or any other associated symptoms and did not have any cardiovascular disease risk factors. On examination, she was stable and in no distress. Her blood pressure was 148/66 mmHg with a regular pulse of 48 beats per minute. She had no clinical evidence of heart failure on cardiovascular examination but was found to have an S4 on auscultation and cannon A waves on assessment of her jugular venous pressure (JVP). Her exam was otherwise unremarkable. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram during the clinic visit revealed complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm at 49 beats per minute with right bundle branch block morphology; her 12-lead electrocardiogram 3 months earlier also revealed evidence of underlying conduction disease with a prolonged PR interval and right bundle branch block while in sinus rhythm. Trans-thoracic echocardiography displayed normal left ventricular size and function with mild degenerative changes of the mitral and aortic valves consistent with age related changes. There was no laboratory evidence of any metabolic or ischemic etiologies for the conduction disease. Given her age, clinical presentation, underlying conduction disease in the setting of no significant structural abnormalities on echocardiography, and lack of significant comorbidities, the patient likely had age related degenerative conduction disease. Significant coronary artery disease could not be excluded but was very unlikely given the lack of ischemic symptoms and cardiovascular disease risk factors along with normal cardiac size and function. She was arranged to have a permanent pacemaker implant for the symptomatic complete heart block and will have further risk stratification for possible coronary artery disease following the pacemaker implantation.The patient was brought to the operating theater following informed consent.

The vertebral lesion was situated on the left transverse process and was separated from the spinal canal (Fig. ). Biopsy specimens of both lesions were histologically similar and showed spindle cell neoplasms with a bland appearance; however, we could not make a definitive diagnosis, owing to the small size of the samples.

{"note": "A 84-year-old female was scheduled for bilateral total hip replacement due to osteoarthritis of both hips (). Medical history included chronic Hepatitis C virus infection with no other medical conditions reported. The patient was allowed to decide which hip would be performed first. 5 months after scheduling, the patient was admitted for surgery arriving in a wheelchair, and new pelvis radiographs were taken (). Other causes of the rapid destruction of the hip joint were ruled out, and the patient was diagnosed of bilateral RDO. Keeping in mind a possible septic etiology, despite there was no history of septicemia and inflammatory markers were elevated due to chronic hepatitis, we decided to take samples for microbiology and histology during the procedures. The right hip was performed through an anterior approach by a senior surgeon following standard antibiotic prophylaxis with 2 g of cefazolin 20 min before skin incision. An uncemented prosthesis was implanted with no complications. Femoral head destruction led to an important defect in the posterior and superior wall of the acetabulum. This conditioned high and medial implantation of the cup to achieve stability. 4 days after the first procedure was performed, one out of six cultures was positive for Enterococcus faecium with no local and systemic signs of infection or pain. Synovial biopsy revealed fibrosis, chronic inflammation, calcifications, macrophages, and osteoclast giant cells with no signs of acute inflammation. Urine cultures were negative. The Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria [] were not met and the patient did not receive antibiotic treatment. 6 days later, after a favorable post-operative evolution, the left hip was performed through a posterior approach by a different senior surgeon with the same hip system but with a cemented stem (). In the left hip, the acetabulum was also affected by the bone destruction, but the cup was able to be placed at a correct height. This ended up with a leg length discrepancy that is well tolerated by the patient taking into account her previous functional status. 5 days after the second procedure and following a post-operative period without complications"}
{"note": "A 60 year old male presented with Staphylococcus aureous infection of his endocardial pacing system. His past medical history was remarkable for mild dilated cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia, a biventricular endocardial pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy, and several previous percutaneous endocardial pacing system implantations via the right and the left subclavian veins. The pacing leads and box were removed and the infection was treated with antibiotics. Due to subclavian vein stenosis and pacing box pocket infection, transvenous approach for implantation of a new pacing system proved not to be feasible. Therefore he was referred for surgical implantation of a new epicardial pacing system.\nA lower half limited median sternotomy was performed starting from the xiphoid process, up to the level of the third intercostal space. A second limited transverse sternotomy was performed starting from the left third intercostal space and joining the midline sternotomy (Figure ). The pericardium was opened in the midline, providing excellent exposure and easy access to both the right atrial appendage and the right ventricle. The right atrial leads were sutured to the surface of the right atrial appendage, while the right ventricular bipolar leads were sutured to the anterior muscular part of the right ventricle. Access to the left ventricle was achieved by gently lifting up the heart, using an epicardial tissue stabilizing system and exposing the lateral wall of the left ventricle with no hemodynamic compromise. The left ventricular lead was screwed into the proximal part of the lateral wall between the obtuse marginal arteries and then the defibrillator patch was sutured to the distal lateral wall. It was made sure that there was a good orientation between the patch and the pacing box which was subsequently inserted in the sheath of the right rectus muscle. The thresholds on the pacing leads were checked and the defibrillating patch was tested. A right subcostal incision was made and a pocket was created in the lateral side of the right rectus muscle. The pacing wires were tunneled between the right hemi-diaphragm and the lateral edge of the right rectus muscle, into"}
{"note": "At the time of diagnosis this patient was a 9 year-old female with a one year history of pain and swelling about her left knee. She had experienced a fall and related all symptoms to the fall. She was seen in her local emergency room by her family physician; there was no diagnosis or treatment. Approximately one month prior to her representation, she was struck in the left knee by a basketball and developed worsening pain. She was seen by an orthopedic surgeon (December 1999) and was noted to have a valgus posture of both lower extremities, exaggerated on the left by external rotation and she walked with a mild limp. The left knee had no effusion but was hypersensitive to light touch over the lateral aspect where there was soft tissue swelling just below the knee. There was no obvious mass in the area, although firm palpation was difficult because of patient discomfort. Plain films were normal and an MR was ordered that revealed an apparent meniscal cyst in the lateral aspect of the left knee [Figure ]. Biopsy of the cystic structure was performed (November 1999) that revealed a high-grade synovial cell sarcoma. Metastatic work-up consisting of nuclear bone scan and CT of the chest were negative. Amputation was offered by the local care team that included a radiation oncologist because of their concern about possible contamination of the joint space and uncertain functional outcome. The patient was referred to St. Jude Children's Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nAt the time of her evaluation after referral (January 2000), there was a well healed scar with no excessive swelling. There was mild tenderness on the lateral aspect of her left knee. Additional imaging studies showed abnormality at the site of prior surgery equivocal for residual tumor. There was no evidence of abnormality in the joint space. The tumor bed was explored. There was no physical evidence of compromise at the level of the joint space. She underwent wide local excision with placement of afterloading catheters. Six catheters were placed in a parallel"}

The patient did not have any relevant comorbidities and her general status was good. The patient underwent a total left hip arthroplasty at the age of seventy four due to severe osteoarthritis pain that hindered baseline activities. Eight years later, the patient presented to the orthopedics department with a progressive pain in the affected hip, particularly when walking, causing difficulties in deambulation.\nAn X ray examination revealed an extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of the femoral component, and an MRI showed a femoral pseudo-tumor (bone proliferation). With this finding, a revision total hip arthroplasty was performed with the insertion of a reconstruction ring with cemented dual mobility cups. Three weeks after this last surgery, the patient started with early symptoms of infection (high fever, suppuration, no wound healing and laboratory abnormalities); an attempt at conservative management with intravenous antibiotic, irrigation and suction drainages was unsuccessful and a replacement of the endoprosthesis femur in two stages was planned.\nIn the first stage, the previous prosthesis was removed with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity and a cement spacer with antibiotic was placed. Two months later, the spacer was removed and a new coated silver total femoral prosthesis was placed.

She was noted to have moderate liver function abnormalities (ALT 3 times normal range) during a medical evaluation. After extensive evaluation of her liver dysfunction no apparent causes were found. She did not drink alcohol or take any medications, and was of normal body weight. Infectious, obstructive and autoimmune causes were ruled out. She was noted to consume a number of dietary supplements and referred to our clinic to address dietary supplement polyherbacy and its potential affect on her liver function tests. She brought all her supplements for review. At that evaluation, we addressed the purpose of her use of each supplement ().\nShe reported adding more and more dietary supplements over the years, as she read extensively and frequently researched the internet for information on these products. Ultimately she felt at a loss as to which supplements might be of benefit or which supplements to stop taking. This patient typically would use less than the recommended dose noted on the label, but at times would use a higher than recommended dose. She also would vary which supplement she might use in any given day. She expressed concern that her dietary supplement intake had gotten out of control and felt she may be addicted to using supplements as they gave her a greater sense of control.\nAfter discussing the purpose for using each dietary supplement and concerns with dietary supplement polypharmacy and its potential effect on her liver dysfunction, she agreed to stop all supplements for the time being, with the exception of calcium and vitamin D, and one multivitamin a day. Until her follow-up visit she would increase her dietary intake of antioxidant foods, acidophilus and omega 3 fatty acids in place of her supplements, and practice mind-body techniques and exercise for health and stress reduction.

She reported having an episode of sudden onset severe headache associated with generalized tonic and clonic fits and loss of consciousness. She regained consciousness after a period of 24 h without any neurological deficit with a complaint of neck rigidity and headache. The patient had a past history of similar episodes dating back 1 year. Upon interview she recalled a long history of trivial headaches, malaise and low grade fever for the past 6 years, whose severity had never warranted any further investigation. She also had a history of intermittent claudication in her bilateral upper limbs. Physical examination revealed no neurological deficit, however, radial and brachial arteries were impalpable bilaterally. Right to left blood pressure discrepancies were detected, measuring at 140/80 from right arm and 160/80 from the left arm.\nA CT brain was conducted that revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular extension (). Similar findings were evident in previous CT scan brain which was done 1 year ago at the previous presentation of ictus (). Laboratory investigation showed raised ESR upto 40 mm/h and C Reactive Protein was positive. Cerebral angiography and aortogram showed total occlusion of left common carotid artery from its origin and 90% occlusion of right common carotid artery from its origin with slightly dilated segment prior to its tapering (). The sole arteries supplying the intracranial circulation were bilateral vertebral arteries and showed saccular basilar tip aneurysm of size 7.30 x 5.39 mm (). Additional imaging showed bilateral occlusion of subclavian arteries from their initial segments. There were extensive collateral branches to intercostal arteries supplying both upper arms (). The terminal aorta was irregular but bilateral renal arteries and other branches of aorta were normal (). We started the patient on 20 mg prednisone resulting in a reduction of ESR as well as normalization of C Reactive Protein. Further the patient was referred for endovascular coil embolization as vertebral arteries were relatively straight and easy to access."}

Progressive atrophy on the left half of the face was initially noticed at the age of 8 years as an area of hyper pigmentation on the left malar area which gradually progressed with resultant atrophy of the underlying fat and subcutaneous tissue resulting in the present disfigurement (Fig. ). However it was not associated with any other symptoms except for the limited mouth opening which the patient experienced gradually as the condition progressed. The patient had not sought any consultation earlier, for the facial disfigurement. Her medical and family history was non contributory. On general physical examination patient was conscious, oriented, a febrile, general condition was fair and vital signs were stable. Right side of the face appeared normal with marked facial asymmetry noted on left side. Head and neck examination confirmed the asymmetry with flattening, hyperpigmented, parchment like overlying skin. There was an evident loss of underlying fat, muscle and subcutaneous tissue giving a sunken in appearance. Thinning of the lips on the affected side with exposition of the teeth due to the corner of the mouth pulled to left side. Ocular examination and skin examination showed no abnormality with any evidence of lymphadenopathy. There was no evidence of sensory or motor deficits on both sides. On palpation, the skin on the affected side was rigid with signs of sclerosis. TMJ on the affected side was tender with deviation to the left on mouth opening. Intraoral examination revealed normal moist mucosa but tense oral mucosa on the affected side. Tongue on the affected side showed marked atrophy on the left side with shift in the dorsal median fissure (Fig. ).

By the time he reached the emergency room, the pain had reached 8 out of a maximum of10 in intensity. The pain was precipitated and aggravated by a stressful situation at home. It radiated to his left shoulder and was not relieved by rest. Patient had a five pack-year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He would occasionally drink alcohol. On further questioning, the patient revealed that he had been having mild left sided chest pains, sharp in nature and similar to the current episode, for the last few months. The pain would occur either with stress or exertion. He did not seek medical attention before because the pain would be transient and go away on its own after a few minutes. He was not on any medications and did not use any pain relieving medicines either for his prior symptoms.\nIn the emergency room, patient was in mild distress and had a blood pressure of 165/81, something new for him. All the rest of the vital signs were normal and both the cardiac and pulmonary examination did not reveal any abnormality either. The basic laboratory work up was normal except a lipid profile showing elevated cholesterol of 238 mg/dl. The patient had an electrocardiogram that showed some premature supraventricular complexes without any ischemic changes. Cardiac biomarkers including serial troponin-I were also normal. The chest pain subsided in the emergency room with intravenous morphine. The patient was admitted to the hospital in the telemetry unit. He was found to have some runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia while in the hospital.

Nevertheless, a slowly growing mass occurred in his popliteal fossa in a year following being subjected to the puncture wound. He resorted to cardiovascular surgery department in another hospital and Doppler ultrasonography together with arteriography was taken. A popliteal pseudoaneurysm was detected in the distal part of the popliteal artery near the bifurcation to the anterior and posterior tibial arteries and was about 4 cm in diameter (). The patient was taken into operation by cardiovascular surgeons after the angiography. He had an excision of the pseudoaneurysm and primary repair surgery to popliteal artery. After surgery, the popliteal artery was patent according to Doppler USG. He had a foot drop after the operation which resolves spontaneously after a year. At early follow-up, a gradually expanding mass recurred in the popliteal fossa. He went to cardiovascular surgery with this complain, but observation was recommended. Monophasic flow was seen on the popliteal artery according to Doppler ultrasonography which was taken 5 years after the operation. He resorted to some medical centers for his swelling to be treated during 10 years after bypass surgery, but observation without any interference was suggested according to the patient's momentary condition. He applied to our department with a huge popliteal mass associated with obstructed popliteal artery.\nOn the physical examination of the patient, there was a large mass (28 × 10 cm) in the popliteal fossa with old surgical scars.

His past medical history included CAD with prior stenting of the left circumflex artery, diabetes with a HbA1c of 5.7 and an 80-pack year smoking history. He reported a 37 kg unintentional weight loss over 6 months with postprandial abdominal pain and nausea. In addition, he had exertional angina relieved by rest and sublingual nitrates. He had an abdominal CT scan for evaluation of the hernia, and this demonstrated severe atherosclerotic abdominal aortic disease with occlusion of the origin of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries and patency of the inferior mesenteric artery. This was confirmed by mesenteric angiography which demonstrated occlusion of the celiac and SMA with a large mesenteric collateral originating from the inferior mesenteric artery (). This artery had a 90% orifice stenosis. With his cardiac history and symptoms, he underwent coronary angiography, which demonstrated significant left main and 3-vessel CAD (). Left ventricular function was preserved with no valvular heart disease by transthoracic echocardiography.\nHe was referred initially for evaluation for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and reported a brief episode of slurred speech in the past 2 months. A carotid duplex was obtained and showed 80–99% left internal carotid artery stenosis and 50–79% right internal carotid artery stenosis. Given his severe symptomatic carotid and mesenteric arterial disease, there would be significantly greater risk of neurological and mesenteric ischemic complications associated with CABG. The decision was made to perform surgical revascularization to address each vascular system in a staged and combined manner.\nThe patient underwent uncomplicated left carotid endarterectomy and was admitted postoperatively. He had no neurologic complications and was taken for combined CABG and mesenteric bypass on the fourth postoperative day. After induction of anesthesia and placement of hemodynamic monitoring lines, the procedure was initiated with a median sternotomy and mobilization of the left internal mammary artery as a pedicled graft.

The patient had noticed these swellings of the calf muscle a few years ago without any traumatic history. He had no pain at night and no fever or medical illness. The past medical history of the patient was uneventful.\nOn physical examination the soleus muscle was swollen on both sides. The swelling was localized on the right leg over the whole soleus muscle, 10 by 3 cm. On the left lower leg the swelling was about 3 by 3 cm over the medial part of the soleus muscle. A dimpling in both legs (right more than left) at the medial calf area was seen while standing (Figure ). There was full strength in all lower leg muscles and the reflexes were normal on examination. The rest of the examination was unremarkable, the overlying skin appeared normal without deformities, erythema or warmth and the arterial pulsations were intact. Laboratory test results did not show any abnormalities. An X-ray did not show any bony irregularities in the tibia.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the legs revealed bilateral multiple saccular intramuscular venous malformations involving the soleus muscle (Figure ). There was no nidus seen on MRI so an arteriovenous form of the malformation was not plausible. Due to its asymptomatic presentation no angiogram or ultrasonography was performed to further specify the lesion.

{"note": "An 18-year-old American college football player presented with a vague headache since he was tackled during exercise several weeks ago. Brain computed tomography (CT) was performed at a local hospital a few days before visiting our hospital because the headache worsened and was not relieved through medication. Initial brain CT revealed a small amount of subdural hematoma on the left cerebral convexity (). Few calcified nodules were noted at the left frontotemporal cortex. However, it was initially considered a simple traumatic hemorrhage and was managed by conservative means. Several days later, the headache aggravated and the patient experienced an episode of generalized partial seizure. On the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed immediately after the seizure, the size of acute hematoma and cerebral edema was markedly increased, and a small enhancing mass was observed at the left cerebral convexity (). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed a 4 mm sized aneurysmal dilatation of the cortical branch of the MCA, which supplies the superior temporal region (). Emergency craniotomy was performed to eliminate the aneurysm and lower the elevated intracranial pressure by removing the hematoma. A large craniotomy was done, and the subdural hematoma was removed by repeated gentle irrigation and suction after small dural incision. While further opening of the dura, we were encountered by several irregularly shaped, hard subdural nodules which were tightly adhered to the dura and the underlying brain (). Upon careful dissection, these nodules were noted to be buried in the sulcus while being severely adhered to the brain cortex and the cortical arteries. Between the nodules was an organizing hematoma and upon careful removal, a pseudoaneurysm of the cortical MCA branch was exposed. The involved MCA branch was carefully dissected and was trapped by clips at the proximal and distal portion of the severely injured and adherent segment, along with the pseudoaneurysm. The aneurysm and the calcified nodules were then excised. The ischemic injury was minimized because the collateral flow retrogradely supplied the distal part of the occluded artery. The patient recovered without sequelae and was discharged after a short while."}
{"note": "An 82-year-old male presented with a large right IIA aneurysm diagnosed during routine surveillance on a long background history of complicated aortoiliac endovascular intervention. His comorbidities included chronic renal failure, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia. He had undergone an endovascular AAA repair 9 years previously for treatment of a 5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. This treatment was complicated by the subsequent development of bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms. In attempting to endovascularly repair these aneurysms 3 years after the initial surgery, a rupture of the right external iliac artery necessitated placement of a covered stent across the origin of the right internal iliac artery and into the body of the main aortic endograft. Ongoing surveillance of his aortoiliac system with duplex ultrasound demonstrated the gradual development of bilateral IIA aneurysms. A dedicated CT angiogram performed 6 years after the IIA origin was covered showing the sac having expanded to a diameter 6.4 cm. The source of expansion was thought to be a type II endoleak from collaterals originating in left iliac system. Endovascular embolisation of these vessels was attempted via a left sided femoral artery puncture, with angiography demonstrating the origin of the endoleak being the right superior gluteal artery that was being fed through a plexus of collateral channels through the body of the sacrum. It was not possible to cannulate these vessels with a microcatheter, and therefore endovascular treatment of the endoleak was not possible. The patient was offered an open procedure to manage the enlarging IIA aneurysm, which was declined due to the significant risks in light of the patient's previous abdominal interventions and poor overall health ().\nThe decision was made to treat the aneurysm via direct puncture method employing a posterior approach under CT visualisation. Under general anaesthetic and with the patient in a prone position, CT guidance was used to insert a 17-gauge needle into the right superior gluteal artery. The artery was accessed via a transgluteal approach with the catheter passing through the sciatic notch. Contrast injection in the angiography suite confirmed the catheter to be situated"}
{"note": "A 44-year-old woman was referred to our hospital from a local clinic for decreased visual acuity in her left eye. Two hours before the manifestation of symptoms, an autologous fat injection was administered in the periocular area under intravenous anesthesia. The autologous fat was obtained from the abdominal area and the procedure was performed by a local plastic surgeon. When the effect of the anesthesia wore off, the patient reported a loss of vision in the left eye. The best corrected visual acuity was 1.0 in the right eye and no light perception on the left side. The left pupil was dilated and a relative afferent pupillary defect was detected. During physical examination, the patient suddenly complained of dysarthria and the skin color of the nose changed to purple (). The patient was immediately transferred to the emergency room and neurological examination, blood tests, and an MRI scan of the brain were performed. Within 30 minutes, the dysarthria improved significantly and the patient was able to speak normally. On examination, the right fundus appeared to be normal but the left showed a cherry red spot with visible emboli in several retinal arteries (). Fluorescein angiography of the left eye revealed markedly prolonged choroidal filling around the optic disc and a delay in retinal arterial filling while that of the right eye revealed no abnormalities (). The results of laboratory examinations were normal, however the MRI scan showed an ill-defined hyperintense lesion at the left insular cortex (). The patient was finally diagnosed with ophthalmic artery obstruction and left middle cerebral artery infarction. The patient was promptly administered ocular massage, intravenous mannitolization, and oxygen and carbon dioxide therapy. Twenty-four hours after autologous fat injection, the left fundus exhibited marked retinal edema and multiple fat emboli and the visual acuity of the left eye was no light perception (). At 2 months after the injection, the patient had no perception of light in the left eye and the left fundus showed optic atrophy, multiple retinal hemorrhages, and a fibrous change on its posterior pole ()."}

The swelling had been gradually increasing in size over the last 8 months with dull continuous pain in the eye and periorbital area. There was progressive diminution of vision for the last 6 months in the affected eye, and at the time of presentation in the hospital, the affected eye was completely blind. The progressive increase in the size of the swelling and pain in and around the eye compelled the patient to avail hospital services. The treatment history was not significant. The patient was being treated by a local doctor with eye drops and certain oral medicines the records of which were not available with her. She did not have any history of significant ocular disease or any ophthalmic surgery. There was no history of similar disease in the family.\nOn examination, an intraorbital mass protruding from the left eye was visible. Axial proptosis with stretched out sclera along with dilated blood vessels covering the entire exposed part of the eye ball was seen. The underlying cornea was barely visible through the widened palpebral aperture with hyperemic keratinized conjunctiva tissue. The swelling was more prominent in the region superior to the upper eye lid. The skin appeared stretched along with dilated vessels in the superior part of the eye ball []. On palpation, the mass was tender and soft in consistency. Fundus examination was not possible because of overlying vascularized keratinized tissue over cornea. The intraocular tension was also not recorded because of these reasons. The status of the pupil of the diseased eye could also not be commented upon, even though it appeared slightly dilated. The patient had no perception of light in the left eye. Ophthalmological examination of the right eye did not show any abnormality both in the anterior as well as in posterior chamber. The fundus examination of the right eye was normal. The intraocular tension of right eye was also normal.\nSystemic examination of the patient"}

He reported to have dyspnea and hoarseness during the previous year. He had undergone a direct laryngoscopy which had revealed left vocal cord palsy and a chest computed tomography (CT) scan which had shown a mediastinal mass and with possibility of a malignancy process a direct needle biopsy was done which demonstrated inflammatory cells in the background of blood. His past medical history only included a mild stroke 6 years before without any sequel.\nAt the emergency department he had pulse rate of 86 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18/min and blood pressure of 135/80 mm Hg. He had a continuous murmur in left sternal and pulmonic area and decreased breathing sound in left hemithorax.\nA chest x-ray was obtained which showed a large density in mediastinum and left sided pleural effusion. In echocardiography he had normal left ventricle but dilated right sided chambers with supravalvular pulmonic stenosis. Trans-esophageal echocardiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm of distal aortic arch with clot formation and compression of the main and left pulmonary artery. As a result a chest CT scan with contrast and angiographic construction was done which confirmed the previous finding of a 45 mm × 37 mm pseudoaneurysm in lateral side of aortic arch distal to left subclavian origin with associated 9.5 cm × 10 cm hematoma in mediastinum ( and ). At this stage and upon further investigation he remembered to have fallen down from a few stairs 10 years ago which did not result in any injuries and accordingly he did not seek medical advice.\nThe patient initially refused operation but a few days later developed severe chest pain and so finally agreed to a surgical plan.\nThe patient had a preoperative selective coronary angiography via right radial artery which was normal.

{"note": "A 38 year old Vietnamese man was admitted with a 10 month history of epigastric pain, fatigue, 10 kg weight loss and recent onset jaundice. He had no other significant medical history. Clinical examination demonstrated anaemia and a tender mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. A computerised tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a 7 × 5 cm thick-walled, complex mass adjacent to the second part of the duodenum, which contained fluid and air and abutted the hepatic flexure of the colon. The working diagnosis was a collection secondary to a colonic perforation and he was treated with intravenous antibiotics. He improved with conservative management and was discharged a month later for outpatient colonoscopy. The colonoscopy revealed a lesion in the transverse colon, histology of which showed a mucinous adenocarcinoma.\nHe subsequently returned to the Accident and Emergency Department following an upper gastrointestinal bleed. On his second admission, a repeat CT scan again suggested localised colonic perforation with formation of an abscess adjacent to the duodenum, along with thickening of the ascending colon, predominantly centred around the hepatic flexure. Given the clinical presentation and diagnostic uncertainty a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed which revealed a large perforated tumour at the hepatic flexure with ascites and peritoneal tumour nodules. A laparotomy was performed via a transverse incision and following mobilisation of the hepatic flexure, a colonic tumour was found to have invaded the gallbladder and duodenum with an abscess cavity anterior to the second part of the duodenum. At the base of the abscess cavity a large hole was apparent in the second part of the duodenum with malignant tumour invading the duodenum. Given the size of the defect (5 cm × 2 cm) and the presence of tumour it was not possible to resect and form a primary closure of the duodenum. The presence of metastatic spread precluded a curative resection by pancreatoduodenectomy.\nA right hemicolectomy was performed to debulk the tumour and an ileotransverse anastamosis formed.

He has a past medical history of coronary artery disease with multiple myocardial infarctions and two coronary stents placed in 2003 and two additional coronary stents placed two months prior to his admission. He had a history of systolic heart failure with a left ventricle ejection fraction of 20%. In the emergency department atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate was noted with a heart rate of 140. A diltiazem infusion was started and he was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. Repeat echocardiogram several days later showed progressive worsening of his ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 18%. He was started on inotropic support and underwent placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) to assist with hemodynamic stability. Approximately 24 hours later the patient had an episode of melena associated with a drop in his hemoglobin from 10.1 to 7.7. He was started on proton pump inhibitor infusion. He underwent emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed erythema and erosions in the gastric fundus compatible with gastritis as well as grade 1 reflux esophagitis but no evidence of active bleeding. A Helicobacter pylori stool antigen was found to be negative. A colonoscopy was performed after hemodynamic stabilization for further evaluation of melena and pretransplant screen. This was positive for abnormal vascularity, congestion, nodularity, erosions, erythema, and ulceration in the cecum and ascending colon suggestive of ischemic colitis which was later confirmed by biopsy (). Given the unusual involvement of nonwatershed areas such as the cecum and ascending colon, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was performed to evaluate the celiac and mesenteric vasculature. There was no significant narrowing of either vessel noted on the CT; however the inferior metallic marker of the IABP was found to be inferior to the origin of the superior mesenteric artery (). Findings were consistent with ischemic colitis of the cecum and ascending colon as visualized on colonoscopy from occlusion caused by the IABP. The IABP was repositioned"}
{"note": "A 30-year-old woman was admitted to our institution in June 2002 for the treatment of a giant fusiform aneurysm of the basilar trunk. A giant ICA aneurysm had been found during a previous evaluation of abducens nerve palsy on her right side in November 2001 (). At that time, a tortuous basilar artery had been found, but without any aneurysmal dilatation (). She had undergone endovascular trapping of the giant fusiform aneurysm, involving the petrous to cavernous parts of the right ICA, at another hospital (). However, she developed severe headache seven months after the treatment. At the time of admission, she complained of progressive dyspnea, as well as dull headache in the occipital area. Neurologic examination revealed a 6th cranial nerve palsy on the right side and increased deep tendon reflexes in the four extremities. On MR imaging, a giant aneurysm of the basilar artery was found to be compressing the brain stem (). Cerebral angiography showed a fusiform giant aneurysm, with an irregular contour, involving the basilar trunk (). The left anterior inferior cerebellar artery originated just proximal to the basilar trunk aneurysm. In addition, another de novo small paraclinoid aneurysm was found on the left ICA.\nTo relieve the brain stem compression, we decided to obliterate the basilar trunk aneurysm in spite of the risk associated with this intervention. In advance of performing endovascular embolization of the aneurysm, a high-flow bypass from the external carotid artery to the middle cerebral artery was performed using a saphenous vein graft. This is because occlusion of the basilar trunk would have endangered the blood supply to the posterior circulation, leaving the left ICA as the only vessel responsible for the perfusion of the entire brain after the basilar trunk occlusion, since the patient had already undergone occlusion of the right ICA. The bypass supplied the right middle cerebral artery territory (), and an adequate blood supply to the upper portion of the posterior circulation was maintained via the left posterior communicating artery (PCoA). During surgery, part of the occluded right ICA was sectioned"}

Physical examination was done in the emergency department and revealed stable vital signs; the patient was conscious, moving all his limbs; there were warm palpable pulses of the upper arms.\nThe CTA of the aorta revealed a large dissection flap from the origin of the left subclavian artery extending down all the way to the level of renal arteries; there was enlargement of the false lumen at the proximal aorta with large aneurysmal dilatation (mural thrombus) and a compression of the true lumen (ascending aorta). Additionally, there was a large entry point seen 2 cm distal to the right subclavian artery. The aberrant right subclavian artery was noted crossing posterior to the trachea and arising as a last branch of the aortic arch distal to the left subclavian artery; also, the left vertebral artery was arising directly from the aortic arch. There was no other evidence of vascular dissection or occlusion below the level of the renal arteries (Figures and ).\nThe patient underwent general anesthesia for thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) two days after his first day of admission; the procedure was done through the right femoral approach; an angiogram was performed intraoperatively (). Stent graft with a size of 34 mm × 15 cm was used and deployed into the descending thoracic aorta; the intimal entry tear was completely covered by the stent, and the false lumen was obliterated.

While he has clear consciousness, he has never walked, as he was unable to move his arms or legs. Since the age of 8, when he suffered aspiration pneumonia, he been completely bedridden and has been using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep. The patient usually has his neck turned to the left because he has difficulty breathing and sometimes experiences signs of dyspnea when he turns his neck to the right. He underwent two rounds of general anesthesia for scoliosis surgery in 2008 and 2010, and had a history of tracheostomy for dyspnea that occurred in the intensive care unit (ICU) after undergoing general anesthesia for the second time. In a limited manner, the patient was able to voluntarily open his mouth and was able to eat regular food. The patient has been complaining of pain in his TMJ and temporal area during mouth opening for 10 years, which hindered him from receiving treatment for long-term molar pain.\nTherefore, he was referred to undergo general anesthesia for treatment of the molar area. However, we decided to defer general anesthesia due to a high risk of respiratory complications based on his medical history and physical examination, and instead performed local anesthesia of his TMJ area. We determined that the patient had severe pain in the bilateral temporal and TMJ area due to hyperextension of the mouth closing muscle while opening his mouth, and perform local anesthesia to alleviate tension in the TMJ and mouth closing muscle area during dental treatment. At the dental clinic, 1 mL 0.5% levobupivacaine was injected on each side of the TMJ and temporalis fascia before performing oral and maxillofacial surgery ().

Digital substraction angiography did not show any arteriovenous malformation, though an early draining vein was visualized []. The patient was managed conservatively. The patient presented 1 year after the episode. She had improved in power in her left sided limbs which was now Grade 3-4/5. She was able to walk on her own with little support. A MRI was performed that showed resolution of the hematoma and the presence of a gliotic cavity. A contrast image showed the normal vessels in the region, and there was no evidence of any flow voids in the region of the cavity. MR angiogram performed at the same time also did not show any evidence of an arteriovenous malformation or nidus []. The patient was again observed and asked to follow-up. The patient presented after 4 years, at the age of 9 years, with complaints of intermittent episodes of seizures. A MRI was again repeated which showed the gliotic cavity on T1 weighted scan. On T2 weighted image, some abnormal vessels were seen in the region of the gliotic cavity. MR angiography showed the presence of an arteriovenous malformation fed by the branches of the middle cerebral artery []. A four vessel angiogram was performed which showed an arteriovenous malformation fed by multiple anterior branches of the middle cerebral artery and drained via multiple veins in the superior sagittal sinus.

Her past medical history included mild Multiple Sclerosis from which she was asymptomatic. She did not smoke or drink alcohol, had no history of corticosteroid, anticonvulsant or anticoagulant use and was not on any other medication. Clinical examination was unremarkable and no investigations were deemed appropriate. The working diagnosis at this stage was non-specific hip pain related to pregnancy and supportive measures were instituted.\nOver the following 12 weeks her hip pain worsened, and she started to experience pain in the contra lateral hip. Again there was no history of a traumatic event. Because of her pregnancy imaging of her hips was avoided. By 36 weeks of pregnancy she was unable to weight bear and became wheelchair bound. Pain in her hips and limitation of motion meant that a normal vaginal delivery was impossible; hence she underwent a caesarean delivery of a healthy baby at full term.\nShe was brought to the attention of the orthopaedic team when plain radiographs (see figure ) following delivery revealed a displaced intracapsular femoral neck fracture on the left and a valgus impacted right intracapsular femoral neck fracture on the right. The radiographs also revealed considerable osteopaenia. MRI (see figure ) revealed these fractures, with reduced signal on T1 and increased signal on T2 in the femoral necks in keeping with TOP.\nShe underwent closed reduction and internal fixation of the left hip. The right hip was internally fixed in situ. Two hole 135 degree dynamic hip screws were used in order to provide sufficient stability to allow immediate mobilisation despite bilateral fractures. Difficulty was encountered in ensuring that the threads of the dynamic hip screw had crossed the fracture site in the left hip as the level of the fracture was high in the femoral neck, consequently the tip of the implant had to be implanted close to the subchondral plate (see figure ).\nThe post"}

She was treated with thrombolysis and endovascular mechanical clot removal ( and ()) with a successful outcome of recovering to a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 2 within 24 hours.\nAs a part of stroke work-up brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. Interestingly magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple infarcts with haemorrhages in the right middle cerebral artery territory and bilateral cerebellar hemisphere raising a possibility of an embolic source (). While reviewing the history, it became obvious that the patient had not been well for the previous four weeks prior to admission. She had a low grade pyrexia and mildly raised inflammatory markers with associated anaemia and thrombocytopenia. All the above symptoms and image findings raised the possibility of infective endocarditis.\nAn urgent echocardiogram established a mobile mass in the anterior mitral valve leaflet indicative of a vegetation which was further proven on transoesophageal echocardiography. It was a large mobile mass measuring about 11 × 4 mm and prolapsing in to the left ventricular outflow tract with mild aortic regurgitation (). She was then treated for infective endocarditis with intravenous antibiotics. Despite therapy she continued to have an intermittent fever with persistent raised inflammatory markers. However serial blood cultures and serology remained sterile. Further studies including virology, vasculitic screen (together with thrombophilia screen) and serology for atypical organisms were negative.\nHence a computer tomography of thorax, abdomen and pelvis was performed to identify an infective focus.

Colonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed, but the bleeding site was not clear in the visible range of the stomach, duodenum, and colon. On hospital day 2, capsule endoscopy was performed, and bleeding from the small intestine was detected. On hospital day 3, the patient developed shock due to massive bleeding. Hence, emergency transcatheter arterial embolization was performed. He had a history of surgery for anal atresia and small bowel stoma as a neonate, and he required hemodialysis because of chronic renal failure with bilateral kidney malformations. Computed tomography performed before transcatheter arterial embolization showed that the anatomy of the left common iliac artery was normal. However, the right external iliac artery was defective. Blood from the right common iliac artery flowed directly into a traveling vessel: the internal iliac artery. The blood vessel descended at an acute angle to the pelvic floor, and then, it rose and flowed into the femoral artery (Fig. ). We chose to insert the catheter from the left femoral artery and then further selectively advanced the catheter to the superior mesenteric artery, which is the responsible vessel for gastrointestinal bleeding. Regarding the superior mesenteric artery, the branch from the aorta was at the same level as the celiac artery, and the right hepatic artery originated from the superior mesenteric artery. But angiography did not show a clear extravasation from either branch of the superior mesenteric artery. Small intestinal endoscopy was performed on hospital day 8. However, it was impossible to advance the endoscope because the small intestinal adhesion was very strong. Thereafter, there was no massive bleeding. He was discharged home on hospital day 20 after red blood cell transfusion. Later, he was hospitalized again for small intestinal resection. In the abdominal cavity, the small intestine was firmly adhered. First, 30 cm of the adhered small intestine was resected.

The history of the present problem went back to the age 45 with an incident of the low back pain repeated at the ages 50 and 52; each time relieved by conventional bed rest and other conservative measures. The progressive changes in lumbar spine (L2-L3) including discopathies and stenosis of the spinal canal were also contributed to his limitation of walking ability for last 10 years.\nThe patient was born as the last member of a large size family of a second degree consanguineous traditional marriage, with the maternal age 43, having 3 sisters and 4 brothers without hip disease.

The patient indicated the pain and tingling in his feet worsened with prolonged standing and walking. He also endorsed lower back pain on follow-up visits. MRI of the thoracic cord demonstrated a longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. The initial workup was unrevealing for an etiology and initial suspicions were that his condition was due to neurosarcoidosis. A lumbar puncture was performed and negative. Upon further review of the spinal imaging it was thought that there may be dilatation of the spinal epidural venous plexus, which would potentially indicate a dural arteriovenous fistula. The patient was then taken for a catheter angiogram for further evaluation.\nDuring angiography, the left and right subclavian arteries were imaged to evaluate for spinal cord blood flow. An injection within the aorta was required to establish a road map for the left vertebral artery and the left vertebral artery origin from the aortic arch was found. An injection of the aortic arch origin of the vertebral artery revealed complete filling of all segments of the left vertebral artery. Retrograde filling of the left subclavian artery was seen indicating a potential dual origin from the left subclavian artery. A catheter was placed within the left subclavian and a second origin of the left vertebral artery was appreciated to originate and merge with the aortic V1 segment at the level of the C5 vertebrae (Figure ). Equal filling was seen from both the aortic and subclavian origin. No aneurysms or dissections were appreciated in either origin or at the confluence. When the right T7 spinal artery was injected, a dAVF was observed.

There was no history of thunderclap headache or any associated visual or neurologic symptoms to suggest aneurysm rupture. Initial angiogram for evaluation of aneurysm, demonstrated a large left ICA para-ophthalmic aneurysm, measuring around 26×19 mm with a wide neck of 14 mm (). There was a patent anterior communicating artery with brisk cross filling of the left cerebral vasculature from the contralateral right side as well as patent left PCOM artery. Considering the complex anatomy, size of aneurysm and presence of good collaterals with patent anterior and PCOM artery, a plan was made in another hospital to treat the aneurysm with parent vessel occlusion rather than flow diverter stent. Subsequently, the aneurysm was treated in October 2016. Initially, a balloon occlusion test of the left ICA was performed which was negative for any neurological change during 20 minutes of balloon occlusion with blood pressure challenge as well. Subsequently, occlusion of the left ICA proximal to the aneurysm was performed using multiple coils (, ). There was no antegrade flow into the left ICA after occlusion with a patent flow into the left cerebral hemisphere through a patent anterior and PCOM arteries (, ). Angiogram of the left vertebral artery after occlusion of left ICA showed retrograde filling of the left ICA para-ophthalmic aneurysm (, ). This was considered to occlude overtime considering the competing antegrade intracranial flow. Patient remained asymptomatic after the treatment. Follow up angiogram after 6 months and 2 years demonstrated no antegrade flow in the left ICA, however there was persistent filling of the left ICA aneurysm in a retrograde fashion through the PCOM artery (). The aneurysm was followed up for another year and showed no evidence of occlusion with similar retrograde filling through the PCOM artery with no much change in its size.

Her examination was normal with no evidence of leg swelling or asymmetry and no evidence of postthrombotic syndrome.\nShe was started on anticoagulation and 3 weeks later had an ultrasound of her left lower limb that showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis, which included the common femoral and external iliac veins. It was concluded that it was difficult to exclude a clot proximal to the iliac vein thus, she was continued on warfarin for 6 months. Following her anticoagulation, she underwent a MR angiogram and venogram. There was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis; however, there was significant narrowing of the upper aspect of the left common iliac vein just as it passed under the right common iliac artery prior to its joining with the right iliac vein. There was no associated dilation of the peripheral left iliac veins, and remaining veins were unremarkable for compression or malformation. These findings were highly suggestive of iliac vein compression.

An urgent CT chest with intravenous contrast showed endovascular stent in place, but the aneurysmal sac was completely occluding the left main bronchus with complete collapse of the left lung but with adequate perfusion. The aneurysmal sac also had a mass compression on the adjacent right main pulmonary artery, which was compressed and stretched maximum at its proximal portion [].\nPatient was stable hemodynamically and with relatively acceptable arterial blood gases.\nHe was monitored closely for possible emergency intervention with an endobronchial stent.\nAlthough placement of an endobronchial stent in the left main bronchus can open the collapsed left lung, at the same time it may increase the pressure and can occlude the compressed right pulmonary artery supplying the only aerated right lung which could cause major morbidity, so, a conservative plan was adopted.\nAfter 18 hours the apex of the left lung started to open up radiologically which"}

Her past medical history included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and twenty years before she had an omphalocele repair. The patient was in a close clinical and radiological follow up for monitoring a pancreatic serous cystadenoma diagnosed incidentally with a computed tomography (CT) scan 10 years earlier. The lesion was extensively studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), fine needle aspiration (FNA), serology and blood test screening. At that time she was addressed for a routine year follow up scan which she attended regularly for six years. Patient did not attend her follow up time table for the last four years. Upon admission to the emergency department, chest and abdominal x-rays were performed and turned out inconclusive. Routine laboratory studies revealed marked leukocytosis, severe anemia, and blood glucose levels exceeding 500 mg/dl. Due to inconclusive diagnosis, an intravenous contrast CT scan was ordered and revealed a large amount of free peritoneal air and free fluid. (Figure , ) Moreover, a left upper quadrant 17 cm large mass originating from the stomach was revealed along with secondary liver lesions. An urgent laparotomy showed a prepyloric ulcer perforation and a large inoperable mass arising from the pancreatic body and largely invading the posterior wall of the stomach occupying the upper abdomen with multiple hepatic secondary lesions. A liver biopsy was taken, the stomach perforation was sutured closed and a washout was performed. The histopathologic findings from the biopsy material were consisted of small and medium size cystic lesions surrounded and divided by hyalloid collagenous matrix. The cysts were lined by cuboidal epithelial cells with clear cytoplasm and round nuclei without atypical or mitotic activity as demonstrated by pathology. The glycogen content was documented by PAS positive reaction. These findings were consistent with serous microcystic adenoma of the pancreas and the malignant nature of the tumor was confirmed by the presence of the extensive invasive large inoperable pancreatic mass with hepatic"}

He complained of pain and paresthesia in the median nerve distribution of the right hand. The swelling measured 6 cms in length and 5 cms in width. The swelling was mobile on the transverse axis and not on the longitudinal axis. There was no motor weakness. There was normal protective sensation present in the hand. Percussion over the nerve produced positive Tinel’s sign. There was no family history of neurofibromatosis and no associated clinical features. The ultrasound showed that the mass was subcutaneous although limited and homogeneous measuring 6 cm in diameter. The patient refused to undergo MRI examination due to financial constraints. A surgical workup and a preoperative anaesthetist assessment were obtained. With a clinical diagnosis of median nerve tumor the patient was planned for excision of the tumor. The patient was explained regarding the neurological deficit following surgery and that she may need a sural nerve graft. The patient was taken up for surgery in supraclavicular block with bupivacaine and Xylocaine under tourniquet control.\nAdequate exposure of the nerve was done both proximal and distal to the tumour (). On exploration the tumour was found to be arising from the median nerve in the right mid forearm. It was a well encapsulated greyish tumour () placed in an eccentric position to the axis of the nerve (). The vascular pedicle in the proximal part of the tumour is identified first and the remaining tumour was gently resected using microsurgical techniques.

On examination he was alert, conscious with pulse rate of 134 per minute, blood pressure of 86/64 mm/Hg, the extremities were cold and clammy. On auscultation, the heart sounds were audible without any adventitious sounds. The breath sounds were diminished in the left lower chest. A chest x-ray was done which revealed multiple rib fracture with mediastinal widening and left pleural effusion. In view of excruciating chest and back pain with features of hemorrhagic shock, a suspicion of aortic injury was made and hence an urgent emergency department CT scan was done after that the patient was shifted quickly to the emergency operation theater without waiting for the reports and the CT film. While shifting to the operation theater the film was obtained on the operation theater console which revealed a contained ruptured aortic rupture immediately below the level of isthmus (). An intervention cardiologist opinion was sought for endovascular stenting but in view of lacerated aorta involving more than 50% of its circumference at the site of injury, it was not possible and hence an urgent open surgical technique was advised. The patient was taken to operation theatre and intubated with single lung tube. He was positioned in right lateral position. A left posterolateral thoracotomy was done and the chest cavity was entered through the fifth intercostal space. A huge contained hematoma was noted. The patient was heparinized a plan to conduct surgery on left heart bypass on normothermia was decided. One of the 16Fr aortic cannula was inserted to the left superior pulmonary vein as outflow circuit and another 18Fr aortic cannula was inserted to the descending thoracic aorta just above the level of diaphragm as inflow circuit and the circuit was connected to the heart and lung machine.

At the admission, physical examination revealed pain and tenderness in the right lower quadrant with no signs of bowel obstruction, mimicking an acute appendicitis. Laboratory investigation has not shown important pathological signs. Ultrasonography examination of the abdomen showed a contracted gallbladder with normal bile ducts, no pathologies affecting the pancreas and neither free fluid, nor signs of acute appendicitis. In consideration of the clinical status of the patient and the persistent acute abdominal pain even with a negative ultrasound, a CT scan was performed to better comprehend the nature of the underling pathology. CT scan was performed four hours after the hospital admission, and demonstrated a thickened cecal wall with a small number of pathological nearby lymph nodes, confirming the absence of peritoneal free fluid. Given the absence of radiological signs of GI perforations and of other surgical and medical emergencies, we decided to perform a colonoscopy to better understand the etiology of the underling pathology. Colonoscopy was performed 24 hours after the hospital admission and after an adequate bowel preparation and revealed a massive, ulcerated, stenotic and necrotic lesion that involved the caecum and the right colon. Biopsies of the lesion were performed and the microscopic examination showed a cell proliferation composed by large, pleomorphic cellular elements with vesicular nuclei, hyperchromatic nucleoli and eosinophilic cytoplasm, mixed with necrotic tissue. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma ().\nFor these reasons, a laparoscopic right colectomy in an elective setting was performed, together with an accurate lymphadenectomy. Surgical exploration of the abdominal cavity confirmed the absence of peritoneal carcinosis and distant metastasis. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed an ulcerated lesion of the right colon with a 6 cm diameter, composed of a whitish and compact tissue, with hard consistency and infiltrative margins that extended to the perivisceral adipose tissue.

She was well until two years after the initial trauma when she met with another road traffic accident. The patient fell off her motorcycle and was brought to our centre with severe right thigh pain. Clinically, the right thigh was deformed with no obvious open wound. There was no other associated injury and the neurovascular status was intact. A plain radiograph shown 30° varus angulation of the femoral nail in the AP view and 30° anterior angulation in the lateral view with the continuity of the nail intact (). The fracture site was noted to be not united with minimal callus formation. It was decided to remove the nail surgically. The surgery was done under regional (spinal) anaesthesia with the patient being placed in the left lateral decubitus position. A skin incision was made by a lateral approach at the fracture site under image intensifier guidance. The tissue was divided layer by layer until the fracture site and the fibrous tissue around it was cleared up.\nThe initial technique attempted was based on the principle of partially weakening the nail followed by manual straightening. The bent nail was partially resected using a jumbo cutter through the wound, then reduction was attempted using the bone holder forceps placed at the proximal and distal part of the fracture site and the strength was applied to straighten the bent nail. However, the correction failed. We then proceeded with the second technique of fully cutting the nail and then extracting it into two different pieces. The distal locking screw was removed, followed by removal of the proximal locking screw. Manual traction was applied as a distraction at the fracture site to fully visualise the apex of angulation of the bent nail. A Jumbo cutter was introduced up to the visible nail and it was sectioned by multiple bites into two parts as shown in . Continuous saline"}

Two coordinates of X-ray chest revealed the presence of foreign body in the (R) hemithorax, we suspected that the foreign body could be in the thoracoabdominal cavity based on the mechanism of injury. CT scan confirmed our suspicion that a sharp foreign body was indeed in the (R) thoracic cavity, not close to major vessels. There was a minimal pneumothorax which was not evident clinically. This sharp foreign body mandated removal. We decided to try minimal access surgery but with full preparations for open thoracotomy in case of failure. He needed one lung ventilation as a prerequisite for thoracoscopy. Hence the procedure was done under general anesthesia and intubated with a double lumen tube. He was placed on the anterolateral right thoracotomy position. Single lung ventilation was instituted. In addition CO2 insufflation was given up to 5mm Hg, for safer initial trocar placement and better visualization of hemithorax. A 10mm camera port was placed in the (R) 5th intercostal space in the anterior axillary line. A 5 mm working port was placed in the same intercostal space.

However, the loading area of the stump had repeated breakdown and the stump became extremely sensitive and painful. He was unable to wear the prosthesis and bear weight on the stump. The bone length was maintained at 12 cm below the tibial plateau and soft tissue cover was possible only at the expense of the shortening of the stump. Salvage of the stump was only possible with adequate soft tissue cover. Reconstruction of the stump was planned with anterolateral thigh flap from the opposite side. The scar tissue was excised completely till the bone. About 2 cm tibial end was projecting in the wound []. A 14 × 14cms flap along with vastus lateralis muscle was harvested with the patient in supine position.

The overlying mucosa was normal and the patient was asymptomatic.\nRadiographic examination revealed an ectopic 23 which appeared to be within the maxillary sinus or a possible large cystic radiolucency surrounding the canine as well as an indistinct area of bony expansion between the 22 and 24 (). There was no evidence of root resorption of the 22 and 24. A cone beam computed tomography (CT) was carried out and showed expanded bone in the 23 region with normal trabecular pattern with intact buccal and palatal cortices, but some buccal cortical expansion. The 23 was located in the left zygomatic bone, with the crown facing buccally and causing dehiscence of the zygomatic bone. The roots were facing toward the left maxillary sinus with the dilacerated apex projecting into the sinus ().

{"note": "The third patient, a 23-year-old woman with recurrent severe depression (see under results Case 3) experienced a prolonged seizure, which was stopped by intravenous application of benzodiazepine. This event mirrored the AEs, which required medical action by a doctor as reported in Case 2.\nThe young lady was a patient with an unusually high health risk for her age because of being obese and suffering from diabetes. Epidemiological studies on the relationship between diabetes and epilepsy reached discordant conclusions. However, it has been reported that metabolic abnormalities, such as hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, may increase the prevalence of epilepsy (). In this line, there are data-driven considerations that mechanisms for the comorbidity of obesity and epilepsy are mitochondrial dysfunction and adiponectin deficiency, which promote epilepsy, obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus (). While fundamental mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and epilepsy remain a matter of discussion, hypoglycemia is an accepted reason for the occurrence of seizures in young patients with epilepsy (). The ECT patient reported here showed elevated blood sugar levels. However, a decline in the blood sugar level during the previous night and due to the ban of breakfast before ECT, which was applied in the early morning hours, could not be ruled out. While the occurrence of a prolonged seizure after the reduction of blood and brain sugar glucose level would be a possible explanation for our patient’s AE, its probability appears to be low. Epileptic seizures with changes in the blood sugar level are rare and not as common as previously assumed and require significant hypoglycemia to occur ().\nThe patient did not show any changes in her respiratory function during ECT despite being overweight. Her obesity might have been a risk factor for altered respiration, in particular when being related to upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea syndrome (SAS; ).

The patient's pain had been progressively worsening and was significant during his chewing of solid foods, resulting in weight loss interpreted as a result of poor oral intake. The pain was described as sharp, lancinating, and throbbing, radiating to the left temple and cheek. The patient rated the severity of the facial pain as 8 out of 10 on the Numerical Pain Rating Scale.\nThe workup prior to his visit included a brain MRI and a maxillofacial CT that focused on the trigeminal nerve distribution in the brain, and facial sinuses identified no neural element involvement, metastases or bony lesions. A PET scan of the entire body at an outside hospital showed a hypermetabolic mass in the distal esophagus consistent with known adenocarcinoma.\nWith the prior diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia, the patient had been on methadone, hydrocodone, and carbamazepine, prescribed by other providers. This combination of medications had failed to improve the pain severity. He was then referred to the center of pain management with the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia and continuing intractable facial pain.\nOn physical examination, the patient was in considerable distress due to the facial pain.

Eight years earlier the same patient, who had a known history of gastric ulcers, presented with a similar clinical picture to a different surgical unit. On admission he showed signs of haemorrhagic shock with a haemoglobin level (Hg) of 7 g dL. Emergency upper GI endoscopy was unable to identify the source of bleeding due to large volumes of blood in the stomach. Surgical treatment with a laparotomy was decided and the intraoperative findings demonstrated an acute gastric hemorrhage secondary to a massive propyloric ulcerative lesion. Resection of the lesion was decided and a distal gastrectomy and Billroth II reconstruction performed. The subsequent histology revealed a <2 cm gastrointestinal stromal tumour, with a mitotic rate of < 5 mitosis/50 per HPF, lacking necrosis and localized to the gastric mucosa. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged eleven days post surgery. The patient was reviewed over the following two years and repeat endoscopies failed to reveal any signs of recurrence. The patient subsequently declined further surveillance and follow up.\nAt his readmission in 2009 the patient was primarily treated conservatively due to his hemodynamic instability. After successful resuscitation, an emergency upper GI endoscopy was performed which revealed an irregularly shaped elevated lesion on the gastrojejunostomy line and a thrombus at the center of the lesion. The hemorrhagic lesion was situated along the posterior anastomotic suture line. Multiple biopsies were performed and a definitive endoscopic haemostasis was obtained.\nPreoperative staging computed tomography (CT) showed no lymphadenopathy or hepatic metastasis and as the patient's performance status was otherwise excellent, the decision for a second operation was deemed favorable.

A draining sinus had developed on the erythematous mass spontaneously and a thick fluid with a chalk-like material was discharged through the shiny skin via the sinus. The range of motion of the knee was 0 degrees to 100 degrees of flexion; ankle dorsiflexion was 0 degrees, ankle plantar flexion was 5 degrees, and all of the toes had clawing deformity. As for the motor strength of the ankle, the dorsiflexion was grade 0 and plantar flexion was grade 3. He had no sensation in the first web space and on the medial aspect of the foot, and had sensory reduction in the lateral, dorsal, and plantar aspects of the foot, in order of decreasing sensation.\nThe radiographs of the left leg taken 10 years"}

He said that he felt that his left hand was not under his control. It would act on its own will, in form of levitation of the arm, purposeless groping of objects in the surroundings. His left hand would hold objects in its vicinity and start using it, for example it would start to write if a pen was present. The left hand also showed interference in the activities of the right hand. Like when he would bring the food towards his mouth with the right hand, the left hand would try and stop it. There was also history of inter-manual conflict in form that whenever he would put his reading glasses with his right hand, the left hand would remove them. When he would button his shirt with the right hand the left hand would unbutton it. When he would wear his cap with the right hand the left hand would pull off the cap and throw it on the ground. Many a times the patient had to use his right hand to control the activities of his left hand.\nOver the last 20 days the patient started feeling that even his left leg was not under his control. While sleeping in the night the left leg would move out of the blanket and would make purposeless levitation movements. Whenever he started to walk he noticed that the left leg would step backwards. Hence he had great difficulty in walking and after effort he would drag the left leg to move forward. The patient did not feel any weakness in the left leg. There was no history of cognitive decline, myoclonus, ataxia, behavior changes, weight loss. There was no history of surgical intervention, or any toxin exposure like bismuth. Examination revealed normal speech and higher mental function. The cranial nerve and motor system examination was normal. The sensory examination showed loss of cortical sensation in form of"}

The pain was relieved by rest and was exacerbated by squatting and sitting cross legged. The patient had difficulty in climbing stairs. On physical examination there was tenderness along the medial aspect of knee joint and a curved scar mark was present over the anterior aspect of knee joint (). While history taking the patient told us that she had a patella fracture around 4 years back which was treated by open reduction and internal fixation and she subsequently underwent implant removal 2 years back. The patient had full range of motion (ROM) at knee joint (Figs. , ) and moderate pain was observed on medial side while flexing and extending knee joint. There was no history of any recent trauma to knee joint. A provisional diagnosis of osteoarthritis knee joint was made and weight bearing standing antero-posterior and lateral x-rays ofleft knee joint were ordered. On X-rays it was found that multiple pieces of broken circlage wire were present around knee joint and one piece had migrated posteriorly (). On examination patient did not had distal neurovascular deficit and patients pain was not related to these broken pieces, rather it was due to degenerative changes in the knee joint. It is believed that the surgeon who did implant removal removed only the K wires leaving behind the circlage wires which broke into multiple pieces over the passage of time due to the repeated stresses at knee joint. Patient was advised to undergo total knee replacement along with subsequent removal of broken hardware as potential undue complications can occur because ofbroken hardware in the form of damage to neuro vascular structure due to migration of pieces posteriorly. It was also explained to the patient that cases have been reported where broken pieces migrate to heart and sternum and produce life threatening complications. However, patient refused to undergo any type of surgery. she was warned and told to be alert whenever the nature"}

She was evaluated by an x-ray abdomen that revealed multiple air fluid levels and the CT – Scan of the abdomen revealed a circumferential growth involving the sigmoid colon with impending perforation and small loculated collections reaching to the superior border of urinary bladder and uterus extending to the lateral abdominal wall suggesting micro abscesses. Gastroscopy performed was normal and the colonoscopy was inconclusive due to narrowing proximal to the sigmoid colon ( and ).\nThe patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and sigmoid colectomy subsequently. The findings were an exophytic sigmoid colon tumor proliferating extraluminally with small bowel adhesions. Tumor was adherent to the lateral pelvic abdominal wall with a subcutaneous abscess pocket. Tumor perforation in sigmoid colon was noted with minimal contamination. Tumor was found infiltrating the lateral wall of uterus. No ascites, lymphadenopathy or free peritoneal/omental deposits were noted.\nThe histopathology report of the patient suggested a moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma with a single sclerosed lymph node suggesting tumor metastasis with foreign body giant cell reaction ().\nThe patient underwent extensive evaluation by gynecology and urology departments to identify a possible primary source of malignancy in the urogenital tract. Their evaluations were negative. The patient did not have any skin lesions or ulcers suggesting skin primary as the source.\nThe patient recovered well from the surgery with parental nutrition support. She was ambulatory and was given oral feeds on 7th postoperative day. Subsequent CT Scan of the abdomen suggested a small fluid collection at the site of surgical anastomosis with few air pockets suggesting abscess formation/leakage. There was concomitant ascites, pleural effusion and a liver lesion noted too in the CT scan. Wound infection was treated with regular dressings initially and later vacuum dressing was applied. After improvement in health, enteral nutrition and wound, the patient was discharged for follow up in 2 weeks. The patient unfortunately passed away at her home"}
{"note": "A male patient aged 17 years and two months presented with a severe thoracolumbar SK. He was otherwise healthy but markedly overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 37. There was no history of spinal infections or injuries and no skeletal dysplasias. There were no associated medical co-morbidities. He had been previously followed but not treated in another spinal unit since the age of 16 years during which period his kyphosis gradually progressed and became symptomatic. On presentation in our clinic, the patient complained of persistent back pain located in the thoracolumbar junction, which affected the level of his activities. The pain did not radiate to his legs and he had no neurological symptoms.\nOn clinical examination, he had a sharply angular kyphosis of 105° with the apex in the thoracolumbar junction, as well as bilateral hamstring tightness. Neurological examination was normal. There was an associated thoracolumbar scoliosis measuring 30° and no evidence of spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis. The lateral radiograph of the spine showed bridging osteophytes anteriorly across the apex of the kyphosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine was performed when he was initially seen at the age of 16 years and showed spinal cord attenuation across the thoracolumbar junction but no cord signal change, no disc herniation and no intraspinal anomalies. There was also no evidence of the bridging osteophytes on the MRI which indicates that these developed spontaneously in order to stabilize the spine as the kyphosis progressed further and the disc spaces collapsed anteriorly. The MRI did not report fusion of the posterior elements across the levels of the kyphosis, as well as congenital vertebral abnormalities.\nIndications for surgery included severe back pain refractory to conservative measures and modification of activities, as well as the extreme degree of deformity and risk for further progression possibly causing neurological complications.\nThe patient underwent kyphosis correction at the age of 17 years and 11 months when the deformity measured 115° and only corrected to 100° on a supine hyperextension radiograph against the bolster.

He had been positioned in the middle of the backseat and was ejected from the vehicle. The injury was reported to have occurred 1 hour prior to presentation at the hospital. Field responders had placed the patient on a backboard and placed a cervical collar. He was resuscitated with intravenous fluids during transport. No manipulation of the extremities was completed prior to arrival. Upon arrival to the emergency room, he was intubated and sedated for airway protection due to low Glasgow Coma Scale. He had sustained facial lacerations and closed head trauma. CT of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained showing a dislocated left hip, with the femoral head displaced into the intrapelvic space compressing the urethra (Figures and ). There was a small bony fragment noted, representing a minor acetabulum fracture, but no evidence of proximal femur fracture. He presented in critical condition due to subdural hemorrhage and was taken emergently to the operating room for a craniotomy performed by the neurosurgical team. Due to the acuity of his head injury, no other imaging of the orthopedic injuries was obtained prior to transfer to the operating room. He was already in the operating suite after completion of the craniotomy when the orthopedic team was able to evaluate the patient. Physical exam demonstrated gross deformity of bilateral lower extremities as both legs were externally rotated and shortened. On the right thigh, there was crepitus at the distal femur suggesting a distal femur fracture. Fluoroscopic imaging was obtained intraoperatively, confirming a right distal femur fracture and left hip dislocation. After receiving clearance from the trauma surgery and neurosurgery teams for further intervention on the patient at that time, the decision was made for emergent closed reduction of the left hip under general anesthesia given the intrapelvic dislocation of the femoral head in this young patient. Given the significant displacement of the femoral head, it was discussed that open reduction may"}

The right groin showed a swelling of 10 × 10 cm. Vital signs and blood tests were normal at the visit. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT showed prolapse of the small intestine into the right groin (Figure ). The hernia was located outside the inferior abdominal wall artery, suggesting an indirect hernia. The size of the hernia gate was 3 × 2 cm. The left side did not show any apparent hernias. On confirming that there was no apparent intestinal ischemia, manual return was performed and the patient was hospitalized for observation. He was discharged 3 days later, after confirmation that there were no complications such as intestinal ischemia. It was agreed upon that surgery would be performed at a later date on a watch-and-wait basis. TAPP was used to repair it. The operation was performed in a supine position under general anesthesia. On placing the 12-mm port in the umbilicus using the open method and examining the abdominal cavity, the coexistence of a femoral hernia as well as an indirect inguinal hernia was observed on the right side. Further observation of the left side also revealed an indirect inguinal as well as a femoral hernia (Figure ). Although the patient was asymptomatic, surgery was also indicated for the left side, and a simultaneous repair was then performed. Two 5-mm ports were placed in the left and right abdomen, respectively, and the operation was performed with three ports in total. The first repair was performed on the right hernia. The peritoneum was linearly incised from the outside of the hernia tract toward the hernia tract, and the space between the peritoneum and the preperitoneal fat was separated to form a space for placing the mesh.

Her second delivery was a spontaneous vaginal delivery in a health center 4 years later with early neonatal death for unknown reasons. She was seen by a health professional only once during the current pregnancy, when she experienced progressive abdominal pain 4 months prior to her delivery. She was assessed in a health center and referred to a regional hospital where she underwent an ultrasound scan and was reassured. She presented to the University of Gondar Teaching Hospital with the principal complaint of shortness of breath with associated progressive abdominal distension and pain. Her last menstrual period was unknown but she reported 9 months of amenorrhea.\nOn general examination, she looked emaciated and was slightly pale. Her vital signs were within normal limits. Her cardiovascular and respiratory system did not reveal any abnormalities. On abdominal examination her symphysis fundal height was term sized, with longitudinal lie and breech presentation. The fetal heart rate was 132 beats per minute and there were no uterine contractions. On vaginal examination the cervix was closed and uneffaced. There was no vaginal bleeding. On ultrasonography examination, there was a singleton live pregnancy with excessive amniotic fluid. The placenta appeared to be attached to the serosal surface of the fundus of her uterus and her uterus was empty. The gestational age was 40 weeks by ultrasound estimation. Her preoperative hematocrit was 34%. An emergency laparotomy was performed with the impression of abdominal pregnancy. Upon opening her abdomen and entering the peritoneum, the fetus was seen in an intact amniotic sac and there was no hemoperitoneum (Fig. ).\nOn opening the amniotic sac a live female neonate was delivered weighing 2.6kg.

{"note": "The adverse reaction to clozapine occurred in a 57-year-old married Caucasian woman with a long history of treatment-resistant chronic schizophrenia (ICD10 F20) who has required continuing care in hospital for many years, due to the severity of her condition. She first developed schizophrenia at around the age of 18 and has received antipsychotic medication for almost 40 years. There is a family history of schizophrenia with her son and a maternal cousin both having the condition. Despite the recognized advantages of treating many patients with schizophrenia in community settings, her symptoms - both positive and negative - have been resistant to a range of treatments and as a consequence she has been in hospital since 1985. Periodically, the patient can also exhibit challenging behaviour that requires skilled nursing support; on occasion, she has required nursing in the intensive psychiatric care unit rather than the rehabilitation ward. The patient has been prescribed many different antipsychotics over the 40 year duration of her illness, including second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic medication, with unfortunately no benefit to symptoms or functioning. A trial of clozapine in June 2003 was discontinued about a month later following development of acute renal failure, when she required transfer to the general hospital unit. At that time, the renal failure was attributed to clozapine by internal medicine specialists, although the patient was also taking lithium at this time, and developed secondary lithium toxicity with a peak lithium of 2.2 mmol/L before all medication was discontinued.\nIn November 2007, after a multidisciplinary case review, it was decided that the patient might benefit from a retrial of clozapine, especially given her failure to benefit from all atypical antipsychotics available in the UK. This was considered a reasonable strategy given that the adverse renal effects seen previously when clozapine had been introduced, were thought to have been caused, or exacerbated by, lithium carbonate. Given the severe and refractory nature of the patient's condition, and taking into account the circumstances of the previous trial of clozapine, there appeared compelling grounds for a reintroduction of clozapine.

Preoperatively, the patient had debilitating bilateral hip pain (right worse than left), and the patient reported shortening of his right leg compared to his left. The surgery was performed without complications, and the patient reported no problems with his THAs for two years with the exception that his right leg was shorter than his left. One year after surgery, the patient had a good Harris Hip Score of 87. Two years after his bilateral THAs, the patient reports developing a draining sinus tract of his left thigh () and bilateral periprosthetic infections which were not confirmed with aspiration. The patient did not want to have a revision surgery and was placed on chronic AST which was managed without the aide of infectious disease or identification of the microorganism. The patient had no risk factors for PJI.\nIn 2004, the patient was first seen in clinic and reported doing well with no hip pain but had some decreased hip range of motion and noted to have Brooker III/IV heterotopic ossification around both hips on X-ray (). He denied any systemic symptoms but was still having some drainage from the sinus of his left thigh. He was encouraged to continue his antibiotics, which at the time was amoxicillin.\nBy his next visit in 2005, the patient had started to wean himself off his amoxicillin as there had not been any drainage from his sinus tract in several months. A discussion took place with the patient in which it was explained to him that there were risks associated with discontinuing his antibiotics and that they had been beneficial in suppressing the patient's hip infection to that point in time. The patient expressed understanding and said he would continue to monitor his symptoms but was going to continue to wean himself off the antibiotics and would be sure to follow up if there were any complications"}

She was found to have an amorphous, invasive superior left mediastinal mass involving the main and left pulmonary arteries with occlusion of the left pulmonary arterial tree and severe narrowing of the right pulmonary artery (). At that time, she was noted to have moderate cardiomegaly with right heart enlargement and findings of elevated right heart pressures as well as several scattered, small nonspecific pulmonary nodules. Subsequent PET scan showed marked fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity of the anterior mediastinal mass. She underwent intravascular biopsy with interventional radiology during that first admission, and an arteriogram revealed a severely stenosed but still-patent right main pulmonary artery with no filling of the left main pulmonary artery. She was discharged with subspecialist follow-up pending biopsy results. However, initial pathology revealed only thrombus material and a minute fragment of unremarkable intima. The patient was unable to tolerate the scheduled cardiac MRI for repeat biopsy planning and was lost to follow-up until representing to thoracic surgery clinic in May 2017 after a progressive decline. At that visit, she was directly admitted for immediate further evaluation given the extent of her mass.\nOn admission in May 2017, her right heart function had declined considerably with echocardiogram notable for a severely dilated right atrium and severely dilated right ventricle with the interatrial septum bowing to the left, suggestive of right heart failure. She underwent a second biopsy via bronchoscopy; however, pathology was again nondiagnostic and notable only for fragments of fibrous tissue with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate.

{"note": "A 64-year-old female presented to the office with the complaint of a back mass. When asked to identify the location of the mass, she pointed to her right scapular line just below the costal margin. The patient reported that she first noticed this mass approximately one year prior to that visit. While it had not noticeably increased in size over the last year, the mass had recently started to produce dull pain.\nThe patient's past medical history was notable only for gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypercholesterolemia, and an overweight BMI of 29.1. When prompted, she denied any history of back trauma or back surgery. During the patient's physical examination, it was difficult to identify the mass at the location she indicated. After palpation in various positions, the mass was finally identified when she was instructed to stand and flex her back forward. In this position, a mass approximately 5 cm in diameter was palpable several centimeters inferior to the point the patient had indicated. The mass was soft and mobile with a smooth border. It was not found to be reducible. Palpation did not produce any pain during this examination.\nAt the time of this office visit, it was decided that the diagnosis of lipoma was appropriate for the patient's back mass. This decision was based on her physical findings as well as an understanding of the relatively high incidence of lipoma for individuals with this patient's chief complaint. Excision of the suspected lipoma was felt to be indicated as the mass was producing discomfort and was believed to be located such that it could be accessed by a minimally invasive approach. During preoperative examination on the day of the surgery, the patient's lumbar mass was once again challenging to identify. Palpation and marking of the mass prior to the procedure could eventually be achieved by placing the patient on her left side with her legs flexed up toward her chest. Palpation of the lumbar mass did not reveal tenderness and the exam was otherwise normal with no identified contraindications to surgery.\nFollowing"}

He is a known hypertensive patient diagnosed four years ago and is on regular medication with a fair response. He denied any known allergy or surgical history. There is no known history of tuberculosis contact or a known family history of epileptic disorders. He admitted to eating pork meat up to four times a week. He was a truck driver and is married with seven living children. This illness led him to stop driving. His wife and children are all doing well.\nThe first episode of loss of consciousness occurred suddenly and lasted for a few minutes. He denied having a prior illness. He was taken to a nearby hospital where he was treated for malaria and soon resumed normal activities.\nHe was doing well thereafter until the following year when he developed a second episode of a sudden loss of consciousness and woke up in a hospital two days later. During hospitalization, he was put on IV fluids and antimalarial drugs. This episode was followed by a severe headache that lasted for two days, temporarily relieved by acetaminophen tablets. Just like in the first episode, he had no prior illness.\nIn the third year from the onset of the first symptom, he developed an episode of generalized tonic-clonic convulsions associated with tongue biting, frothing from the mouth, and neck stiffness.

It was said that 2-week training at the Marine training center consisted of 2–3 h of swimming training a day and 2 h of basic physical strength reinforcement training. The swimming training consisted of repetitions 50 min of swimming and 10 min of rest. The swimming portion consisted of swimming 25 m back and forth four times at full strength followed by swimming the same distance four times at low speeds. The trainees would then rest and begin again. The basic physical strength reinforcement training consisted of repeating walking and running for around 1 h followed by weight training to reinforce upper and lower extremity muscular strength. The degree of difficulty was no different for him than for his colleagues.\nDue to pain in the both hip joints and the left ankle he visited a private clinic, but although a simple radiological examination was performed no abnormal finding was found (Fig. a); anti-inflammatory analgesics were prescribed and immobilization was recommended. At 4 weeks after enrollment, he presented at our hospital due to the aggravation of his right hip joint symptoms, a simple radiological examination was performed on the hip areas reported to be painful, and the radiographs obtained revealed a displaced femoral neck fracture (Fig. b). A bone scan showed hot uptakes at both hips and at the left ankle joint, MRI revealed fractures of both femoral necks (the right side was displaced and complete fracture) (Fig. c). He underwent open reduction and internal fixation at right hip using cannulated screws. The region of ankle joint hot uptake by bone scan was also investigated and found to be due to a slight fatigue fracture and articular depression of the subtalar joint and diffuse edematous change around the calcaneus on MRI. However, the patient has never made any specific complaint regarding the ankle joint. The left hip and ankle joint were treated conservatively by stabilization and long leg casting.\nHowever, reduction loss was noted 2 weeks after"}

This was associated with nausea and loss of appetite, made worse by movement and not relieved with intramuscular morphine injection. There was no history of recent or past trauma to the chest or abdomen. On examination, she was tender in the right upper quadrant and right iliac fossa with rebound and guarding, with a Rovsing positive sign and normal bowel sounds. She was incidentally found to have some marfanoid features including the long span of upper limbs, a high arched palate and the very soft early diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation. The patient had a positive family history of Marfan's syndrome but had never undergone genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis.\nA likely diagnosis of appendicitis was made on the clinical picture associated with a pyrexia and raised white cell count and C – reactive protein. Her abdominal X-ray at that time showed absence of gas in the right side of her bowel. Her chest X-ray did not show any obvious abnormality (Figure )\nShe was taken to theatre the same day for appendicectomy through a standard right iliac fossa incision. There was a small amount of free fluid but the right iliac fossa was filled with a normal looking gall bladder and small bowel only with no sign of the caecum, appendix, ascending or proximal transverse colon. The terminal ileum was found to run up under the right lobe of the liver towards the hilum. The right iliac fossa wound was closed and we proceeded to an exploratory laparoscopy.\nAt laparoscopy, the liver was retracted to see under the right liver lobe. The proximal transverse colon was found to be running up towards the liver hilum were it felt to be tethered. This suggested a possible herniation of the right colon into the chest.

RH experienced this pain about once per week and it lasted for 'a couple of days'. RH had a secondary complaint of headache, which began about the same time as her primary complaint. The headaches were described as a band of pain across her forehead along with an ache at the base of her skull and in her temples. Past medical history was unremarkable save for shingles in 2004. Routine physical examination was unremarkable. Following history and examination a working diagnosis of mid-back pain of mechanical origin with associated muscle hypertonicity was established and a course of chiropractic treatments proposed. Treatment included SMT to the spinal levels thought to have restricted motion, soft-tissue treatment to the musculature of the upper back and a recommendation for core stability exercises. On a subsequent visit RH reported that she could neither lie prone on the treatment table nor could she perform even the most basic core stability exercises because to do so would result in severe abdominal pain, throat tightness and headache. Following further questioning it was determined that RH had been experiencing this triad of symptoms since she was eight years old and had subsequently avoided any activity that placed pressure on her abdomen, such as sitting close to a table when studying or performing abdominal exercises. Medical investigation for her symptoms had yielded neither a diagnosis nor a treatment. RH traced her symptoms back to a ballet class when she was age eight years during which she was required to lie prone on a wooden floor and, while holding onto her ankle, attempt to touch her toes to her head.

{"note": "An 87-year-old woman presented to the accident and emergency department after sustaining a fall while on holiday. She complained of pain and reduced range of movement in her left shoulder. Her past medical history included hypertension atrial fibrillation, for which she took aspirin 75 mg once a day. She had previously undergone a thyroidectomy in 2000 for hyperthyroidism. She was otherwise fit and well with no known drug allergies.\nOn examination her left arm was bruised and painful when movements were attempted. Her distal neurovascular status of the affected limb was normal with no deficit detected. Plain film radiographs of her left shoulder demonstrated a minimally displaced and impacted fracture of her proximal humerus (as shown in ). After discussion with the orthopaedic registrar on call she was placed in a collar and cuff and sent home to attend the next available fracture clinic.\nWhen she was reviewed in the following fracture clinic it was noted that she had developed a swelling and erythema on the left side of her neck in the distribution of her external jugular vein (as shown in ). It was also found that the collar and cuff had been applied rather tightly. She was referred to the on call ENT registrar who made a diagnosis of thrombophlebitis of her external jugular vein. Further questioning did not reveal a history of further thrombotic events. The ENT registrar felt the erythema may be developing cellulitis and so started the patient on antibiotics (flucloxacillin 500 mg four times a day for 5 days) and placed her in a better fitting sling. The fracture was deemed suitable for nonsurgical management with regular clinical and radiological follow-up. As she was only on holiday in the region, further follow-up was arranged for two weeks in her local hospital.\nTwo days later, she represented to the accident and emergency department with pain and gross pitting oedema in her left arm. A Doppler scan demonstrated near complete occlusion of the left subclavian and axillary veins consistent with a deep vein thrombosis. She was started on"}

He was referred from the medical department for complaints of increased water intake with two episodes of abnormal movements. Abnormal movements were characterized by sudden tightening of limbs and jaws with jerky movements with urinary incontinence and loss of consciousness one month prior to the visit. Patient was evaluated and found to have low serum sodium levels. The jerky movements were attributed to hyponatremia induced seizure due to increased water intake. On elicitation of history from patient, his wife and his brother who accompanied him, reported that patient was apparently functioning well until 2 to 3 years ago when he had an episode of fever following which he started reporting complaints of weakness and anxiety. He reported that he was advised by the doctor to drink fluids, following which he initially started taking increased amounts of water per day and gradually the intake was raised to about 10 liters / day. He started feeling thirsty while talking or after micturition and there was a need to drink water after every five to ten minutes and also, after whenever he passed urine. He reported that he would feel anxious and irritable if he was unable to get water or if family would stop him from taking water. His appetite had decreased and he had suffered loss of weight over the period of 2 years and had thoughts preoccupied with water intake. He would always keep a 2 liter bottle of water with him. He also lost interest in work and stopped going to work, citing weakness and fatigability all through the day as the reason for absenteeism from work. There was no history of sadness of mood or any other depressive symptoms. No psychotic symptoms could be elicited and no other obsessive thoughts, images or impulses or any other"}

His symptoms had started a number of years prior. Before the initiation of these symptoms, he denied having any significant medical problems. He had a history of smoking for 20 years. In his family history, no relevant medical condition and/or history of cancer was identified. He had been referred to a surgerical clinic three years prior in which he had a biopsy of the tumor reported as mucinous adenocarcinoma. It appears that he had been evaluated only for possible intestinal primaries at that time and having failed to identify the primary, had been sent to receive radiotherapy of unclear dosage. After the recurrence of his tumor, he was referred to the medical oncology department at our hospital with a mass in the left thoracic region and another in the left humerus, visible on X-rays (). His examination revealed a mass in his left breast besides the aforementioned ones. His biopsy materials were reevaluated in our pathology department and confirmed to be metastatic adenocarcinoma. The report also indicated that the mass might be breast originated, raising the suspicion towards a possible breast primary. He was then given neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and capecitabine for six cycles following the decision of our tumor council.\nAn magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was obtained following the cessation of his chemotherapy revealing a 140 × 100 × 90 mm lobulated mass in the proximal epiphyses, metaphysis and diaphysis of the left humerus, which was destructing the cortices on multiple sides with a large soft tissue component, and invading and protruding out of the skin ().\nAnother mass, 123 × 54 × 74 mm in size, was located in the axillary region adjacent to the thoracic wall infiltrating the skin, surrounded by multiple nodular masses of different sizes.

His symptoms started a month ago without any specific trauma. He had a history of open reduction and internal fixation performed for a tibial plateau fracture that occurred when his left knee was pinned under a tree 18 years ago. He had sciatic nerve injury at the time of the fracture. He had an open reduction and internal fixation as well as a stent insertion in the femoral artery 8 years after the initial trauma due to a distal femur fracture and femoral artery rupture. At that time, a widespread radiopaque mass was observed on plain radiographs of left leg, and obstruction of popliteal artery with abundant collateral circulation was observed on angiography. The patient had no difficulty with his daily life functions until the aforementioned symptoms appeared, except for limited motion in the ankle and toes and sensory reduction in his foot owing to the sciatic nerve injury.\nAfter admission, the patient maintained with a long leg splint. Two weeks after the admission, the erythematous changes in the left leg localized to the anterior aspect in the middle of the leg and formed a fluid-filled, erythematous mass. A draining sinus had developed on the erythematous mass spontaneously and a thick fluid with a chalk-like material was discharged through the shiny skin via the sinus.

{"note": "A 39-year-old female presented to the outpatient clinic with the complaints of recurrent painless swelling in the left thigh and had a history of surgery twice for its removal. She was apparently well until 2001 when she noticed a painless swelling over left mid-thigh. The swelling progressively increased in size and she underwent surgical excision in 2005. She remained asymptomatic for the next 2 years when she again noticed a new swelling over the left distal thigh which was excised surgically in 2009. She remained asymptomatic for the next 3 years when she had a recurrent swelling over the left distal thigh. The swelling was progressively increasing in size and was associated with some discomfort. At the time of presentation to us, she had a large, oval, around 8 cm × 4 cm size, painless swelling over the medial aspect of the left distal thigh. There was a healed scar over the left medial thigh with quadriceps wasting. The swelling was intramuscular on clinical examination. Systemic examination was unremarkable. She was further evaluated with radiographs of the thigh which was suggestive of fibrous dysplasia. This led us to go for a thorough skeletal survey, which showed the involvement of the left femur and tibia (). She was also evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of whole of the thigh which showed two additional soft tissue masses; one in left mid-thigh and the other in the left inguinal region (). As the previous biopsy report was suggestive of myxoma, clinical diagnosis of Mazabraud’s syndrome was made. The patient decided for operative management of the large distal thigh symptomatic swelling and conservative management for the remaining two small, asymptomatic swelling. After informed consent, she underwent wide excision of the distal thigh swelling through the previous skin incision. The mass was intramuscular, located within vastus medialis. A single, globular, pale white, encapsulated nodular mass measuring 8 cm × 4 cm × 3 cm was excised (). The mass weighed around 88 g.

{"note": "An 80-year-old woman was referred to our clinic with a history of chronic abdominal pain and weight loss of 10 kilograms in the past six months. The patient was postmenopausal for 30 years and had a free medical history. Physical examination revealed no tenderness, but a hard and mobile mass palpable in the right iliac fossa. Further investigation by means of transvaginal ultrasound revealed a cystic formation, sized 83 × 65 × 64 mm in the right adnexal area. The mass was of mixed structure, comprising of solid and cystic areas. The wall was smooth and anechoic on ultrasound imaging. No papillary projections or septations were identified and there were no signs of blood flow during the color Doppler evaluation. The left ovary was illustrated measuring 25 × 13 × 11 mm, but the right ovary could not be visualized (Figures and ). A polyp of the endometrium was also recorded, with total endometrial thickness of 8 mm. No free fluid was seen in the Douglas pouch. However, it was inconclusive whether the mass originated from the right adnexa or it concerned a uterine necrotic leiomyoma that protruded towards the adnexa. Because of the indeterminate ultrasound findings, an abdominal CT scan was carried out which identified a cyst sized 100 × 80 mm with signs of peripheral calcification attributed to a lesion of the right ovary (Figures and ). As a routine investigation, when an ovarian tumor is suspected, our patient underwent colonoscopy, during which a benign polyp of the sigmoid colon was excised; also a submucosal round smooth cystic formation of one cm in diameter at the site of the appendix was identified. Tumor markers were within normal limits, with the exception of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA: 54, 2 ng/mL).\nThe patient underwent laparotomy with the diagnosis of a pelvic mass, in which a cystic tumor originating from the appendix, sized 80 × 90 mm, was identified, whereas the uterus and ovaries were atrophic.

Patient gave no history of trauma and extractions in relation with the missing teeth. The patient reported that the teeth exfoliated due to loosening. The patient's medical history was not contributory. Family history revealed no such abnormality among other family members.\nOn intraoral examination [] the morphologic appearance and color of the permanent teeth were normal. In maxillary arch, the missing teeth were from right canine region to left canine region and in mandibular arch, all the incisors were missing. There was generalized grade II and grade III mobility. Oral hygiene was poor and there were plaque and calculus deposits in all the quadrants. Restorations were present in left maxillary first molar and mandibular second molar.\nPanoramic radiograph [] revealed adequate enamel thickness on the cuspal tips of all the teeth. There was no root formation in most of the teeth while some of the teeth exhibited short, blunted and malformed roots of only a few millimeters with obliterated pulp chambers. The mandibular first left molar tooth had taurodontism like appearance. Well-defined periapical radiolucencies were present in association with the apex of the mandibular left first molar and right first and second molar.\nAlthough the patient had attained her physical maturity and was ready for definitive dental treatment but her physical, financial and psychological situations were important to be considered in selecting the final treatment plan. The following treatment plan was formulated for the patient. Dietary and oral hygiene instructions were given to the patient and extraction of the teeth that were mobile was advised along with the rehabilitation of the missing teeth with prosthesis.\nThe right maxillary first molar tooth was extracted and sent to Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology.

She was newly diagnosed with SLE after a spontaneous miscarriage during the second trimester of pregnancy. Due to significant proteinuria and microscopic hematuria a kidney biopsy was performed which revealed crescentic focal segmental glomerulonephritis [class III lupus nephritis with crescents according to WHO classification ()]. She was initially managed with a combined therapeutic regimen of cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids and azathioprine which was modified due to poor response, to mycophenolic acid with the addition of rituximab. However, despite the absence of extra-renal manifestations of lupus, kidney function gradually deteriorated and patient reached ESKD about 4 years after the initiation of immunosuppression. Peritoneal dialysis was the type of renal replacement therapy that was initiated with the concomitant administration of hydroxychloroquine and low dose methylprednisolone.\nShortly after the induction of peritoneal dialysis, the patient presented with fever for the first time. All possible infectious causes were investigated including peritonitis, catheter related infection and a lupus flair, nevertheless no definite diagnosis was reached, and she was managed with empiric antibiotic treatment that led to full recovery. During the next 12 months she had 3 more hospitalizations with fever as main cause of admission and all workups were inconclusive except her last admission when high CMV viral load with 157.000 copies/mL was found. Further investigation revealed remarkably low serum immunoglobulin levels and five pulses of intravenous immunoglobulin were administered. In this direction, supplementary investigation for hypoglobulinemia was performed with repetitive measurement of immunoglobulin levels after a symptom free period which confirmed earlier findings with low IgA, IgG and IgE levels but slightly elevated IgM levels (). Then on, patient had no major complications apart from two to three episodes of upper respiratory infections and acute tonsilitis each year. Evaluating both clinical course and laboratory findings the monthly administration of intravenous immunoglobulin was initiated as acquired immunodeficiency was the most likely cause.

Intraoral examination revealed similar vesicular eruptions on the left side of the mid-palatine suture involving the hard and soft palate, not crossing the midline. Based on the clinical findings, the patient was diagnosed as herpes zoster involving the ophthalmic and maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. After a thorough medical evaluation and required investigations, the patient was put on antiviral therapy, Acyclovir 800 mg orally 5 times daily for 7 days. To combat pain, tramadol 50 mg twice daily was given. At 4 weeks follow-up revealed good improvement in lesions, the lesions of the face and palate showed remission [].

Over a period of time the bowel got contained and the patient was put on oral nutrition. The patient was discharged was doing fine at home. However his abdominal wound was not healing. In the fourth month it was covered with the split thickness skin graft. The procedure and the post-operative period was uneventful till one month. However in the fifth month a serous discharge from the upper part of the grafted surface was noticed. It was coming from a small ulcer and was small in amount. Over a the period of time till he presented at our OPD it remained small in output. It was managed by applying gauge pieces over the wound which has to be changed once or sometimes two to three times a day.\nThe examination of the abdomen revealed a 12 cm × 5 cm elliptical patch of skin graft over the middle of the abdomen. There was a small depressed ulcer of around 1 cm × 1 cm in its upper part covered with pale granulation showing serous ooze.

Among the studies requested, an abdominal tomography showed a right adrenal gland nodule of 14x9 mm and another one in the left adrenal gland of 23x18 mm (), additionally multiple vertebral fractures were reported. As part of the study of adrenal adenomas the patient had an abnormal value of cortisol after a low dose suppression test with dexamethasone (13.3 µg/dL (normal value: <1.8 µg/dL), with a normal value of free urinary cortisol and her potassium was low (she was not on diuretics). The results of the patient laboratory test are shown on .\nWith these results an ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) independent form of hypercortisolism was diagnosed and because the scan of the abdomen had documented the presence of two adenomas, one in each adrenal gland larger than 10 mm, we found ourselves with a therapeutic challenge since the resection of one of the glands may not cure the hypercortisolism in case that the hormonal production came from both glands and the resection of both glands with leave the patient with a permanent hypoadrenalism. It was decided then to perform an adrenal venous sampling to try to determine the origin of the of cortisol production.\nA previously described protocol was used with some changes. The authors of the original protocol propose the measurement of epinephrine as a method to determine the proper location of the catheters when performing the sampling. Because we do not have readily available the measurement of plasma catecholamines the test was performed using radiographic documentation of the tip of the catheter and aldosterone levels were used to make the corrections in the dilution between both sides .

On initial examination, the patient was found to have massive skin and soft tissue defects on the anterior aspect of the elbow. The median nerve and brachial artery were exposed and contaminated (). In addition, the proximal part of the entire extensor muscle group was lost, along with segmental loss of the radial nerve with a 6-cm gap. The patient could not extend the right wrist or fingers, and severe muscle weakness (0 or 1 on manual muscle testing) was found in the area innervated by the median and ulnar nerves. The distal area of the right arm showed signs of perfusion, albeit weaker than that in the contralateral arm. The wound was irrigated and debrided, but a bacterial infection was detected after a few days and threatened to obstruct the brachial artery further. The patient was returned to the operating room for additional debridement, a saphenous vein bypass graft to reperfuse the occluded artery and placement of a muscle flap to close the open wound using the distal part of the extensor muscles, which were not salvageable due to the proximal muscle injury and the radial nerve defect.\nThe infection resolved following those surgical procedures. Six months later, the ulnar collateral artery was found to perfuse distally due to occlusion of the saphenous vein graft. Muscle strengths in the area innervated by the median and ulnar nerves improved to 2 or 3 on the manual muscle test, but there were no signs of recovery in the extensor muscles ().

In December of 2010 he underwent an uncomplicated robotic assisted radical prostatectomy. At the time of the operation a 12 mm trocar was placed in the right lower quadrant, and it is unclear from the operative note whether the fascia was closed at the conclusion of the operation. He recovered from the surgery without issue but unfortunately developed widely metastatic disease over the next 18 months. Upon presentation to our clinic in May of 2012, he was complaining of a two-week history of right lower quadrant pain and a newly discovered mass in the vicinity of a previous trocar site. He initially noted the onset of the pain when performing pull-ups at a local gym, at which time he noted pulling sensation in the right lower quadrant. Following the initial onset of symptoms, he continued to have pain in the area and noted an intermittent bulge as well. He presented for initial evaluation by his primary care provider who obtained a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. The scan revealed a 10 mm right lower quadrant hernia with herniated fat and a tubular structure which was read as a possible omental vessel, with concern for incarceration (). Upon reviewing the CT with the patient in clinic it was felt that the tubular structure was actually the vermiform appendix and thus laparoscopic incisional hernia repair was recommended.\nHe presented the following week for an elective hernia repair. Pneumoperitoneum was established through a 12 mm umbilical Hasson port. Two additional 5 mm ports were then placed, one in the left lower quadrant and one in the suprapubic area. On inspection of the abdomen there was no evidence of peritoneal disease. The right lower quadrant was then inspected, and as suspected from preoperative imaging a small hernia was identified which contained an incarcerated appendix ().

Sensation and vascularity of the foot were normal. Radiographs of the injured foot showed dorsal dislocation of the first and second MTP joints with dorsal displacement of the sesamoid complex ().\nAfter thorough irrigation and debridement of the wound under local anesthesia, reduction was attempted within four hours of the injury using longitudinal traction and dorsally directed pressure over head of metatarsal through the wound and simultaneous plantar directed force on base of proximal phalanx in hyperextension as well as neutral position of the MTP joint, but reduction was not achieved. Patient was then investigated further and in the emergency OT under spinal anesthesia around 12 hours after the injury, reduction was again attempted but failed.

{"note": "A 25-year-old Caucasian female presented to our care with a chronic history of regurgitation of previously ingested food. For the past 4 years, she regurgitated immediately in the postprandial period, occurring within 5 - 25 min after per oral (PO) intake and lasting up to 2 h. These acts of regurgitation were frequently observed by friends and family. When she presented to our care, she was very malnourished and had been maintained on nocturnal jejunal tube feedings. She also complained of multiple bouts of watery diarrhea, amounting to as much as ten episodes per day. Due to the repercussions of her illness, she avoided social gatherings and was not able to maintain her job due to these frequent episodes of regurgitation and subsequent vomiting or swallowing of the food.\nHer past medical problems included asthma and anxiety. Since the beginning of her symptoms 4 years ago she was misdiagnosed multiple times with other gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, she unnecessarily underwent many diagnostic studies and invasive surgical procedures. This downward spiral started when she was being evaluated for right upper quadrant abdominal pain associated with persistent episodes of vomiting. She subsequently had an abdominal ultrasound revealing biliary sludge and HIDA scan with an ejection fraction of < 20%. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in March 2010 based on the assumption that her condition was of biliary disease etiology. Her symptoms persisted despite this procedure, and idiopathic gastroparesis was the next assumption on their differentials of postprandial nausea and vomiting. The diagnosis of idiopathic gastroparesis was aided by a delayed GES. A unique finding from this evaluation was that some of the isotope was immediately regurgitated after being ingested. A normal upper endoscopy was also noted at this time. After failing medical therapy for gastroparesis, a gastric stimulator was placed in October of 2010 but with only < 10% improvement of symptoms. As a result, the patient underwent a pyloroplasty in January of 2011. Her symptoms improved for 2 - 3 weeks but then recurred and became associated with watery diarrhea. Her nutritional status"}
{"note": "The patient was a 47-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who presented to our institution with dysphagia and neck pain after multiple previous cervical spine surgeries at an outside hospital. Her history began with an ACDF from C5 to C7 in 2009 for neck and arm pain. Following her index procedure, she experienced nonunion with loosening of screws and thus underwent a revision extension ACDF from C3 to C7 in 2010 which resulted in significant and immediate neck and arm pain relief. Despite her pain relief, her postoperative course was complicated by superficial surgical site infection necessitating irrigation and debridement 3 days later and antibiotics. Despite no apparent intraoperative complications or oropharyngeal perforation, she experienced significant dysphagia following the third surgery, and, despite unremarkable serial esophagrams, required a feeding tube for approximately 1 year. Gradually, after this period of oropharyngeal rest, her dysphagia somewhat improved and she was able to tolerate a mechanical soft diet with some difficulty. The patient had sustained pain relief but persistent dysphagia for approximately 3 years without any additional work-up. The patient initially presented to our institution following a low-energy fall. Her symptomatology had not changed but routine cervical spine imaging was obtained and she was subsequently referred to our spine specialty clinic for continued evaluation.\nAt the time of her presentation, her plain film radiography () and computed tomography (CT) of the cervical spine () revealed nonhealing posterior pseudarthrosis with local kyphosis, screw loosening, plate migration, and air communicating with the plate raising concern for esophageal perforation. In the context of her persistent dysphagia, mild pain, and imaging findings, it was deemed reasonable to proceed with neck exploration in conjunction with our otolaryngology colleagues with plans to remove hardware and then perform staged revision extension of previous fusion from a posterior approach.\nThe patient was brought to the operating room and direct laryngoscopy was performed.

Endoscopic ultrasound similarly showed a large submucosal mass (). A first endoscopic biopsy result was non-specific and showed acute and chronic inflammation with ulceration. The second biopsy revealed ulceration and tissue granulation with foreign body giant cells suggestive of a barium granuloma.\nAn abdominal CT scan demonstrated about 5.5 × 3.2 cm sized, well-defined and large exophytically growing mass arising from the posterior aspect of the lesser curvature side in the gastric body. The mass showed a large ulceration at the gastric luminal side and a cavity in the central portion communicating with the gastric lumen. The bulk of the tumor was seen in an extragastric location with extensions into the gastrohepatic ligament and lesser sac. There was no evidence of direct invasion of the adjacent organs or peritoneal spread. No metastatic lesions or lymphadenopathy was seen in the abdomen or pelvis. The mass showed relative hypoattenuation on the precontrast images () and increased heterogeneous enhancement in the portal phase () and prolonged enhancement in the equilibrium phase images (). The radiologic findings were distinct from those of epithelial tumors and the possibility of a malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the stomach was considered on CT. The mass was removed under general anesthesia by laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach. During laparotomy there was a round and well demarcated mass arising from the lesser curvature side of the gastric body, and there were prominent vessels around the mass with no detected ascites and no adhesion to the adjacent structures. On gross pathology, the specimen consisted of a portion of the stomach measuring 8.5 × 5 cm with an attached ovoid and lobulated rubbery to firm solid mass measuring 5.4 × 5.2 × 4 cm. The mucosa of the stomach was retracted by underlying the attached mass. Section"}
{"note": "A 56-year-old male patient, whose plasmacytoma was enucleated 3 years ago from the medial side of the left mandible, was referred to our clinic due to his complaints of persistent orocutaneous fistula (Figures –). Past medical history revealed that the patient was operated three times to close the orocutaneous fistula by local flaps; however, none of these operations were successful. CT images of the patient demonstrated that the medial side of the left mandible was missing and there was a 3 × 2 cm diameter defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland. The main reason of the failed attempts to close the fistula was considered to be the ineffective management of dead space surrounding the fistula. Consequently, it was decided to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect and support the oral and the cutaneous flaps.\nUnder general anesthesia, the fistula was excised initially and the oral and the cutaneous healthy soft tissues were prepared. At the extraoral site, the incision was extended to the posterior and anterior directions, following the previous incision lines. In the subplatysmal plane, the superficial layer of the neck fascia was dissected to reach the base of the mandible. After the dissection of the fascia, the submandibular gland and the base of the mandible were exposed, the soft tissues surrounding the submandibular gland were dissected, and the gland was mobilized by protecting the arteriovenous supply and the duct. At the oral site, the margins of the wound were released by blunt dissection and were closed by mattress sutures via 5/0 polypropylene. Following the mobilization of the gland, a soft tissue tunnel was prepared between the submandibular space and the defect area and the submandibular gland was rotated by passing the gland through the soft tissue tunnel by preserving the pedicle (). The rotated gland was sutured to the recipient site with 3/0 reabsorbable polyglaction sutures for the stabilization. At the cutaneous site, the flap was closed"}

According to the patient one year prior to our consultation, he got the maxillary molars extracted from a local dentist due to pain and mobility of the teeth in that area. Upon consultation patient revealed that the pain continued to exist even after the extraction.\nThe extra oral examination was within normal limits with no evidence of lymphadenopathy. The patient is a known hypertensive and is on medication since three years for the same. The patient had smoking habit, which he quit only a couple of years ago. Intraoral examination revealed a solitary erythematous swelling with diffuse borders involving the left posterior portion of hard palate and was also seen involving the soft palate on the same side. The swelling was seen extending from mesial aspect of first premolar to 1 cm posterior to tuberosity on left side, involving the palatal area but not crossing the midline []. An oro-antral communication was seen with purulent discharge. The remainder of the intraoral examination was within normal limits.\nThe swelling was nontender. The inspectory findings were confirmed on palpation. CT scan revealed complete obliteration of the left maxillary sinus []. The clinical differential diagnosis included a benign or malignant neoplasm of minor salivary glands, a neoplasm of maxillary sinus.\nAn incisional biopsy of palate and sinus lining was performed. Histopathological examination revealed fibrous stroma with areas of hyalinization. Islands of uniform cells arranged in cord-like pattern with hyperchromatic nuclei were seen enclosing round to oval pseudocystic spaces in the stroma. Few of these spaces showed eosinophilic coagulum []. The tumor cells are also seen arranged in the form of solid islands [] and ductal pattern [].

Clinical examination revealed that the lesion was located mostly in the right side, extending from the limit between the hard and soft palate and continuing to the oropharynx. The lesion had smooth surface, hard consistency, and irregular shape (). Cervical tomography was requested (Figures and ). Based on clinical and imaging aspects, a hypothesis of benign X malignant salivary gland tumor was formulated. An incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia to establish the definitive diagnosis. However, the histopathological examination of the fragment revealed normal mucosa (). The professionals decided to perform a second conventional biopsy giving attention to collecting material from a greater depth. Once again, the histopathological analysis revealed normal mucosa ().\nThe otorhinolaryngologist team was consulted and the decision was made to perform a CNB. The localization of the lesion was identified during the intraoral exam with no need of imaging guidance (). In CNB a needle is activated by an automatic spring system equipped with outer cannula and inner stylet. Under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine the biopsy area was chosen with palpation of the lump and the tip of the needle was positioned adjacently to the lesion. The handpiece was activated, moving quickly 20 mm back and forth, cutting a sample measuring 17 mm in length. Only one core of tissue was obtained and carefully removed from the biopsy needle. The quality of the specimen was assessed by visual inspection and, with care not to damage the thin tissue, it was put into 10% formalin for fixation. The biopsy site was compressed for five minutes to avoid bleeding and the patient was observed for more 30 minutes and later discharged as no signs or symptoms as bleeding or pain were noted. The histopathological analysis of the sample revealed pleomorphic adenoma (Figures and ).\nThe patient was referred to the head and neck service for complete resection of the tumor.

The patient displayed a clear state of consciousness in neurological examination, his papillary reflex was normal, and nystagmus was not observed. The patient fell toward left even with his eyes open in the Romberg test and displayed dysmetria on the left side in the cerebellar function finger to nose test. Brain CT taken in the emergency room displayed the formation of a common wall, including the wall that enhanced the contrast in a circle of 5×5 cm toward the left cerebellum and a manifestation in which it pressed the brain stem and the fourth ventricle (). With the suspicion of brain abscess in the left cerebellum, the patient was admitted to the neurosurgical ward and received antibiotic treatment. Two days after he was admitted to hospital, his state of consciousness suddenly altered to drowsy and craniotomy and drainage of abscess was performed in response. As a result of requesting department of otorhinolaryngology for phy-sical examination in order to assess the causative diseases after surgery, it was found that the external auditory canal was narrow and aural discharge and granulation tissue were observed in the left ear. The right ear was normal. Tympanic mem-brane retraction and the aural discharge that accompanies keratin were also observed ().\nOn temporal bone CT taken with the suspicion of left otitis media cholesteatomatica, an overall destruction of the cochlea and vestibular organ in the left ear caused by cholesteatoma was indicated ().

She had a medical history of insertion of an IUD inserted 9 years ago. Three months after the insertion of IUD, she fell pregnant unexpectedly. It was her third pregnancy when she was 35 years old and previously she had two children who were 9 and 10 years old at that time. At the visit for pregnancy, the string of the device had not been detected by her gynecologist and it was assumed that IUD had been expelled spontaneously. She had continued her pregnancy and had a normal vaginal delivery without complication. Forty days after delivery, a second IUD had been inserted for contraception. After insertion of the second IUD she had no complaint in the following six years. The second IUD was removed 2 years before her presentation by her gynecologist because of the persistent urinary symptoms which was of newly onset. Physical examination at that time did not show any remarkable finding. Urinalysis was indicative of pyuria and hematuria and urine culture was negative. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed an echogenic intravesical lesion measuring about 27 mm with distal acoustic shadow suggestive of a foreign body or calculus. Plain radiography of the pelvis was not informative enough to show details of a foreign body.\nBecause of a lost IUD history and abnormal localized hyperechogenic lesion which was suggestive of a foreign body, we had planned a medical consultation to obstetric and gynecology department. Gynecologic examination reported that there were no visible strings of an IUD and cervix was closed. Transvaginal ultrasonography had revealed that more than half of the echogenic foreign body seemed to be in the bladder and a small part of it in the uterovesical space (). For confirmation and definitive diagnosis, cystoscopic evaluation was performed under local anesthesia and revealed a partially embedded intravesical IUD on the posterior bladder wall, complicated with a stone formation (Figures and ).

The patient is a 42-year-old female who presented to her local medical officer with a two-week history of neck pain and radicular like pains extending into her right arm. A CT scan of her cervical spine revealed multilevel intervertebral disc and facet joint degenerative change resulting in neural exit foraminal narrowing. She was noted to have raised inflammatory markers (WCC 27.5, neutrophils 24.8, and CRP 319) and S. aureus was isolated on a blood culture. She was commenced on IV antibiotics; however her symptoms failed to improve and she subsequently developed significant lower back pain for which a CT of her lumbar spine was arranged. This revealed no convincing evidence of a lumbar spine infective process; however a 47 × 31 mm solid upper pole mass with an irregular periphery and internal calcification was identified in the left kidney, suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma.\nThe renal mass was further characterized with a triple phase abdominal CT scan and this confirmed a 4 × 4.9 × 4.5 cm heterogenous mass in the upper pole of the left kidney. There was no evidence of left renal vein involvement nor was any radiologically significant lymphadenopathy seen. Her films were reviewed and the decision was made to biopsy the left renal mass to establish whether the lesion was neoplastic or inflammatory. A core biopsy of the left kidney was reported as a Fuhrman grade 1, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (). She was then booked for an elective laparoscopic left radical nephrectomy. She underwent this procedure without complication and had an uneventful postoperative course subsequently being discharged home on day four.\nMacroscopic examination of the surgical specimen revealed a tumor in the mid portion of the kidney located superior to the renal hilum measuring 48 mm × 40 mm × 46 mm"}

The peritoneal fluid was sent for microbiological investigations and he was given IP vancomycin 2 g and ceftazidime 1.5 g as per the hospital empiric protocol. The culture grew coagulase-negative staphylococcus resistant to beta lactams but sensitive to vancomycin. The IP ceftazidime was discontinued after 2 doses and he continued IP vancomycin every 4 days for a total of 3 weeks. The vancomycin dose was adjusted according to serum vancomycin level and the level remained greater than 25 mg/L throughout the treatment with the highest level being 35 mg/L. His levels were kept deliberately high as he was due for a live donor kidney transplant the following month and the treating team wanted to minimize the risk of relapsed peritonitis.\nOne day after completing the course of vancomycin, the patient presented with general malaise and a skin rash which had begun on the abdomen and progressed to involve the entire trunk and proximal limbs. He reported intense pruritus and pain. He was hypotensive with mean arterial blood pressure of 50 mm Hg, heart rate 115, and temperature T 39.1°C. There was a diffuse blanchable papular rash involving the trunk and proximal limbs without blistering or sloughing. There was no mucous membrane involvement and no lymphadenopathy.

The patient had a medical history of cancer in the right breast in 1984 with subsequent treatment including unilateral mastectomy, radiochemotherapy and secondary reconstruction with a subpectoral silicone implant. In 2015 the patient was diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma in the right thigh and bilateral pulmonary metastases. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) wedge resection of the right lung and during this procedure iatrogenic perforation of the silicone implant and injury to the thoracic wall occurred. The thoracic cavity was closed and the perforated breast implant removed without diagnosis of the defect.\nIn stabile condition, the patient expressed a strong desire for breast re-implantation and during this procedure the defect of the thoracic wall and parietal pleura was observed. As the defect was minor, simple closure of soft tissue over the defect would be appropriate in patients not planned for breast reconstruction, however the patient in this case had expressed an extremely strong desire for breast reconstruction. In case of direct closure communication would persist between the lung and the capsular space and therefore it was necessary to close the defect with a thin layer of material allowing both secure closure of the defect and re-implantation. The highly vascularised capsule is known to be appropriate for creation of flaps and grafts, and has previously been used in management of issues in relation to breast implants []. The capsule tissue was an appropriate choice for creation of a pedicled flap in this case because the tissue presented a minimally invasive treatment option for the patient compared to closure with a muscle flap or addition of non-autologus tissue such ADM, increasing infection risk. The anterior part of the capsule in relation to the pectoral muscle was dissected free from the upper pole to the inframammary fold resulting in a medially and centrally vascularised flap. The flap was rotated with the agglutinating side facing downwards to cover the pleural defect and sutured shut. The"}

The only surgery he had was a right inguinal hernia repair. He is not overweight.\nIn April 2016 he had two papillary tumors which appeared to be Ta. He underwent a transurethral resection and the pathology was low grade Ta. His first surveillance cystoscopy was negative. In October 2016 he had four LG Ta tumors which were resected. This was followed by 6 weeks of intravesical chemotherapy using mitomycin C.\nThe patient was tumor free until August 2018 at which time he was found to have multifocal bladder cancer. A transurethral resection revealed high grade Ta urothelial cancer. There was also focal carcinoma in situ. Lamina propria and muscularis propria were present and were free of cancer. He received one dose of intravesical MMC postoperatively. He elected to have a consultation here in South Florida.\nHe presented with nocturia×4 and some daytime frequency.

The swelling was gradually increasing in size. The parents gave no history of any unusual crying of the baby, which concludes that it was painless. On our examination, the swelling was around 4×2 cm in size. It was pulsatile on palpation, and there were no motor deficits in the left hand. This swelling was localized in the left hand hypothenar eminence, and both the radial and ulnar pulses were palpable with a good capillary refill. On taking a detailed history, the mother explained that the baby had the habit of hitting his left hand mainly on the table while having food and on other objects. With the clinical history and examination, an aneurysmal swelling was confirmed, most likely arising from the ulnar artery or the palmar arch because of its location. He came in with an arterial duplex, which confirmed only an aneurysmal sac. There was no detailed anatomical description because of the compromised examination due to the age of the child. No other investigations were carried out to confirm the diagnosis because of financial limitations and the very young age of the child, and we opted for surgical excision directly. Intraoperatively, it was an aneurysmal swelling involving the ulnar artery from below the wrist and at the distal forearm involving the superficial palmar arch distally and taking the digital blood supply of the little finger and the ring finger with it (). This aneurysm was excised and repaired with an interposition reverse cephalic vein graft from the forearm of the same side ().

Over a period of time the bowel got contained and the patient was put on oral nutrition. The patient was discharged was doing fine at home. However his abdominal wound was not healing. In the fourth month it was covered with the split thickness skin graft. The procedure and the post-operative period was uneventful till one month. However in the fifth month a serous discharge from the upper part of the grafted surface was noticed. It was coming from a small ulcer and was small in amount. Over a the period of time till he presented at our OPD it remained small in output. It was managed by applying gauge pieces over the wound which has to be changed once or sometimes two to three times a day.\nThe examination of the abdomen revealed a 12 cm × 5 cm elliptical patch of skin graft over the middle of the abdomen.

The patient developed ASO in the right lower extremity as a complication of diabetes. Arterial occlusion started from 10 cm distal to the knee joint and involved the anterior tibial artery, posterior tibial artery, and peroneal artery. The patient had already had right second and third metatarsophalangeal joint disarticulations in the plastic surgery department of our hospital. Nevertheless, infection and necrosis in the right foot progressed rapidly and worsened to a condition requiring additional surgery (). However, because a tibial IM nail had been inserted into the ipsilateral limb, the patient was referred to the orthopedic surgery department.\nAbove-knee and through-knee amputations were also considered surgical options for the patient. However, it was determined that the blood flow to the distal part of the popliteal artery was intact. Also, infection and necrosis had not progressed beyond the foot. The skin color of the right calf seemed healthy on physical examination. Therefore, we decided to remove the tibial IM nail and perform a below-knee amputation. However, performing additional surgery around the knee joint to remove the tibial IM nail was thought to have a high possibility of complications. Thus, surgery was planned to remove the amputated limb and IM nail at the same time by performing an amputation with the nail fixed on the ankle by distal locking screws.\nThe tibial bone cutting level was determined by referring to the lateral view of the tibial plain radiograph. The tibial IM nail is designed to have an anterior angulation in the proximal part. Therefore, if tibial bone cutting is performed distal to the angulation of the nail, the nail may not be removed from the proximal part of the tibia due to the angulation of the nail. Therefore, we decided to perform tibial bone cutting at the point of the anterior angulation in the nail to leave as much of the tibia as possible (). In this patient, the anterior ang"}

However, 12 years following his 2nd operation, he presented with a discharging sinus in epigastrium (fig ) which was initially treated with dressings and antibiotics by his GP. Exploration of the sinus under general anaesthetic was undertaken after the sinus failed to heal. The sinus was in communication with anterior mediastinum by penetrating the rectus sheath and was divided at the point of entry into mediastinum and removed. All sternal wires were removed. Microbiology of the excised tissue revealed staphylococcus aureus infection and this was treated with appropriate antibiotics for 4 weeks. However, the wound failed to heal although he never developed any signs of systemic illness. A CT scan of chest showed an encapsulated mass extending from ascending aorta to the diaphragm and normal sternum. Transthoracic echocardiography ruled out pseudoaneurysm of ascending aorta, prosthetic endocarditis or aortic root abscess.

However, dehiscence of the repair had occurred and the patient continued to leak urine from the lower abdominal wall. Six months following this, an ileal conduit urinary diversion was done to prevent the continuous leakage of urine. Six month prior to presentation, the patient had noticed an irregular mass arising from the exposed bladder mucosa that was rapidly increasing in size. On examination, a hemispherical growth with an irregular surface was seen in the region of the exposed bladder mucosa (). The computed tomography scan showed a mildly enhancing nodular lesion on the right side of the lower abdomen superficially. The lesion was confined to the urinary bladder. A wedge biopsy was taken from the growth, and the results were suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma. The results of a routine hematological evaluation, liver function tests, and a chest radiograph were normal. The patient thus underwent removal of the urinary bladder along with a cuff of the surrounding abdominal wall and pelvic lymph node dissection (radical cystectomy). After resection, there was a full thickness defect of the lower abdomen about 8 cm×9 cm in size. To cover this defect, the peritoneum was mobilized on both sides and was sutured in the midline. Both recti were also mobilized and sutured in the midline. The skin defect was resurfaced with an extended groin flap from the left side and the secondary defect thus created was covered by a split thickness skin graft (, ). Histopathological examination of the resected specimen was suggestive of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma infiltrating the underlying muscle (stage pT2a) with dense lymphocytic infiltration of the stroma. All the resected margins and deeper plane of resection were free of tumor (). In the postoperative period, the patient developed a small collection beneath the flap that was drained by removal of two stitches, and daily dressings were done.

He assumed the role of a parent for her and followed her up for treatments in the hospital, caring for her at home after surgery and supporting her emotionally as well. As his father was not educated and sister too young to understand, he did not share much of his loneliness and distress with anyone. After the surgery slowly over a period of a year, his mother's health improved, which relieved his distress.\nThe second complex caregiving episode was when his father died due to a sudden cardiac event (massive heart attack) 4 years back. This was a major turning point in his life. He felt all alone. He hardly used to discuss all his fears with his father, but still, he felt that his father was the only source of social and emotional support for him. Furthermore, seeing the mother in grief and fearing the ill effects of stress on her health. He now realized that he has to be the support system for his whole family. With responsibility came more stress, which further strained him emotionally.\nHe describes the present complex caregiving situation due to the pandemic as the worst experience in which it seemed to him that there is only sadness, distress without any hope of something good.

She developed symptoms such as pain upper abdomen, feeling of fullness even with small meals, and loss of appetite just 1 month after her stenting. Perplexed by her symptoms, she visited the hospital in January 2020. She underwent a battery of investigations including an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy which suggested a growth at the lower end of the stomach compromising the gastric outlet. After having a tissue diagnosis of adenocarcinoma stomach, the patient was devastated and worried about the outcome the disease will have for her. The patient developed a ray of hope when she was planned for surgery considering the localized nature of the disease. She was informed that an early diagnosis and treatment will have favorable outcomes for her. She was scared by the outcomes and extensive nature of the surgery but still hoped to get through it and be better.\nHowever, when her surgery time neared, the country had been hit by the pandemic. Because of the few people being diagnosed of coronavirus, the hospital where her surgery was planned decided to put on hold major elective surgeries to avoid the risk of coronavirus to patients. She was informed that her surgery was canceled to avoid any risk to her health considering her high risk for complications because of the pandemic. She recalled that she felt like the floor slipped off from under her. Her caregiver stated that they understood that the decision of postponing of surgery was in their favor, but they were distressed by the fact that what if it progressed. Their mind kept wondering if there was some way that they could get the surgery done and still did not get the infection. They were advised certain home-based medications for the disease to tide over some time.\nAfter 1½ months of this, the patient presented in the emergency department of our hospital with progressively increasing dysphagia, multiple episodes of vomiting,"}
{"note": "A 48-year old Caucasian man presented to clinic for evaluation of his options for the treatment of brainstem fibrosarcoma. In 1977, 26 years prior to this presentation, the patient was diagnosed with a large pituitary adenoma based on a head computer tomography. Biopsy was not performed at the time. However, he received conformal fractionated radiotherapy of unknown dose. He also had concurrent hydrocephalus and a ventriculo–peritoneal shunt was placed. The patient was asymptomatic until 2003 when he started to develop eye left eyelid drooping and diplopia. A magnetic resonance study performed in February of 2004 showed a right brainstem lesion. Stereotactic needle brain biopsy was performed but the results were inconclusive. The patient was followed with serial neuroimaging until August of 2006 when the tumor experienced significant growth associated with progressive neurologic impairment. At that time a second stereotactic biopsy was performed, which also failed to show the pathology of the tumor. In May of 2007, the patient underwent subtotal resection of his large right pontine enhancing mass. Pathology results revealed that the tissue was most consisted with grade 2 fibrosarcoma. Post operatively the patient suffered a pseudomeningocele at the incision site, which required a VP shunt revision. Subsequently he presented to our clinic for reevaluation of this therapeutic options. After careful consideration of the different options available we decided to use a combination of metronomic cyclophosphamide at 50 mg a day and Imatinib 400 mg a day. The choice of Imatinib was based on the newest published data on the soft-tissue sarcoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors sensitivity to Imatinib [] and the recent clinical trials showing that this chemotherapy agent is a potential option for primary malignant gliomas []. Cyclophosphamide is very commonly used in the treatment of multiple CNS malignancies such as malignant glioma and meningioma [], and also shows good activity in the treatment of systemic fibrosarcoma [] which motivates our decision to include this drug in this patient’s regimen.\nThe patient tolerated the treatment well, with slow improvement in his neurologic function and with minimal (grade II"}

Past medical history revealed that the patient was operated three times to close the orocutaneous fistula by local flaps; however, none of these operations were successful. CT images of the patient demonstrated that the medial side of the left mandible was missing and there was a 3 × 2 cm diameter defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland. The main reason of the failed attempts to close the fistula was considered to be the ineffective management of dead space surrounding the fistula. Consequently, it was decided to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect and support the oral and the cutaneous flaps.\nUnder general anesthesia, the fistula was excised initially and the oral and the cutaneous healthy soft tissues were prepared.

{"note": "Mrs. S, a 36-year-old patient underwent IVF for tubal factor infertility in January 2007, with beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) being positive on 20 Jan 2007. Early ultrasound showed a twin pregnancy, each containing a yolk sac and a live embryo. One sac was placed low towards the cervical canal while the other sac was placed towards the fundus, corresponding to 6 weeks of gestation. Early ultrasound suggested the possibility of a low implantation but did not confirm heterotopic pregnancy. On 4 Feb 2007, the patient was hospitalized in view of one episode of bleeding pervaginum. Keeping in mind the diagnosis of threatened abortion, she was managed conservatively and was discharged after 3 days. A repeat ultrasound at 7 weeks and 5 days of gestation confirmed the diagnosis of intrauterine and cervical heterotropic pregnancy []. The patient was readmitted on 19 Feb 2007. Fetal reduction of cervical pregnancy was performed under general anesthesia by injecting intrathoracic potassium chloride under transvaginal ultrasound guidance. The cardiac activity of the intrauterine fetus was found to be normal after the procedure was completed. The patient was discharged after 2 days. The rest of the pregnancy went uneventfully, except for mild vaginal spotting off and on. At 28 weeks of gestation, the patient was readmitted with asymmetrical intrauterine growth retardation. Fetal Doppler study on ultrasound showed reduced umbilical blood flows with adequate liquor and normal middle cerebral artery blood flows. She was serially monitored with biweekly ultrasound for fetal Doppler blood flow studies. At 31 weeks of gestation, a lower segment cesarean section was performed in view of absent end diastolic umbilical arterial fetal blood flow with reduced amniotic fluid index (amniotic fluid index 5). A male baby weighing 1.16 kg was born on 26 July 2007. Intraoperatively, the lower uterine segment showed presence of trophoblastic tissue and hemostatic sutures had to be taken in view of active bleeding from the anterior wall near the isthmus. The lower segment was ballooned up. Post-operative ultrasonography showed the presence of small amounts of trophoblastic tissue with low vascularity"}
{"note": "An 18-year-old male reported to our emergency department with a history of pain in the right shoulder and inability to move it without significant discomfort. He reported that he had been assaulted 4 weeks before the presentation and had sustained head injuries. He had been admitted elsewhere for the management of those injuries and had been managed on an indoor basis for 16 days. His shoulder discomfort had not been thought to be serious during his stay in that hospital. Orthopaedic consultation had been recommended at the time of discharge. Examination revealed a reasonably maintained contour of the shoulder with total restriction of abduction. The patient was able to internally rotate the shoulder up to 20° and external rotation was not possible (Figs. , , ).\nRadiographs of the shoulder showed that the proximal humerus was fractured, and the proximal end of the distal fragment had migrated proximally to lie under the deltoid giving it a near normal contour. The head was dislocated inferiorly. This was confirmed by the axillary view. A significant callus had formed around the head and the shaft at their new position of contact.\nIt was obvious that the proximal pull on the distal fragment had made it migrate proximally.\nAccording to these findings, open reduction and reconstruction of the proximal humerus were considered necessary. Under general anaesthesia, the patient was placed in a supine position and the glenohumeral joint was assessed via a deltopectoral approach. The axillary nerve was palpated to ascertain its position. The long head of the biceps was still intact. The glenoid cavity and the proximal humerus were exposed, and granulation tissue and the callus were cleared from it. After meticulous removal of the scar tissue, the glenoid articular cartilage looked to be in good condition and the humeral head was reduced.\nAs expected, it was not possible to reduce the distal fragment to its normal position beneath the head of the humerus. The end was stripped of soft tissue and shortened by 2 cm. This made the reduction possible beneath the head."}

We also recovered from his discharge note that, during the first 48 hours of his hospitalization, a progressive decrease in the hematocrit value from 41% to 28% was noted. An abdominal CT scan at that time showed a small amount of fluid in the rectovesical pouch with no solid organ abnormalities and a large hematoma in the subcutaneous fat tissue on both lumbar areas. He was hemodynamically stable and he had a transfusion with one unit of packed red blood cells and three units of fresh frozen plasma. He improved rapidly with conservative treatment and was discharged on the fifth day, asymptomatic. One month later he started to have episodes of vague abdominal pains and frequent episodes of diarrhea after meals. Our patient also mentioned that during that four-month period he had lost 10 kg in weight. Due to his fear of the resulting diarrhea, he had cut down on eating.\nOn our patient's current admission he complained of a colicky pain at the periumbilical region for the last 24 hours and two episodes of vomiting. On physical examination his abdomen was mildly distended with a diffuse tenderness on the hypogastrium. There was no rebound or guarding and palpation did not reveal any abdominal masses. His bowel sounds were increased. His blood tests were unremarkable. Plain abdominal X-rays revealed a dilated small bowel loop consistent with intestinal obstruction.

His wife pulled over and, in A& E, he was found to have a large superior mediastinal shadow, extending into neck, on chest X-ray (Figure ). CT scan revealed a 7 cm × 11 cm saccular aneurysm arising from the distal aortic arch between the origins of the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, with cephalic ectopy. Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated large saccular aneurysm of the distal aortic arch with turbulent flow at the left subclavian artery. MR scan confirmed the presence of a large distal aortic arch aneurysm arising from the aortic arch between the origins of left common carotid and left subclavian arteries with extreme displacement of both vessels, the left common carotid artery being displaced anteriorly and to the right and also stretched and distorted owing to vertical expansion of the aneurysm posterior to it, and the left subclavian artery displaced well down and posteriorly into the left chest with even greater distortion (Figures and ). An aortogram clarified the situation further by showing that the aneurysm involved the arch beyond the origin of the left common carotid artery and that the left subclavian artery had been displaced by the aneurysm posteroinferiorly into the left chest. There was a great tortuosity and redundancy of the aorta between the two vessels and the aorta and aneurysm rose well into the neck.

Color Doppler and continuous wave Doppler assessment was consistent with severe pulmonic insufficiency with large regurgitant jet size and broadwidth (vena contracta jet width to transpulmonary annulus ratio 64%) as well as a dense jet on continuous wave Doppler with greatly increased pulmonic systolic flow compared to systemic flow by pulsed wave Doppler [Figure and ]. She underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram to assess her functional capacity but was only able to tolerate 3 min of exercise on a standard Bruce protocol, achieving 4.6 METS with a peak heart rate of 210 bpm (124% of the maximum predicted heart rate) limited by exertional dyspnea. The stress echocardiogram was nondiagnostic for the detection of ischemia due to submaximal workload achieved; however, no segmental wall motion abnormalities were seen.

Also, in the past, the patient underwent a surgery on his right hip after a traffic accident that he had 2 years before.\nHis clinical examination showed increased reflexes of his left leg without other neurological findings. A brain CT scan without contrast was initially performed and revealed a lesion in his right parietal-occipital lobe. The additional intravenous administration of contrast medium showed that the dimensions of the lesion were 7.5 × 2 × 4.6 cm. The contrast uptake and the density of the tumor were heterogeneous. There was also 1 cm middle line shift to the left as well as elevation of the right occipital horn. The patient had screws in his right hip, which were surgically removed in order to perform an MRI for further investigation of the tumor.

He was emergently brought to the trauma center in stable condition. His primary survey revealed diminished breath sounds over his right hemithorax in conjunction with an increased respiratory rate. On further examination, he did appear to have crepitus over his right clavicle and gross deformity in his right thigh. Neurologic and vascular examinations of his extremities were normal.\nRadiographic analysis of his chest revealed a right proximal third clavicle fracture with inferior displacement complicated by a partial pneumothorax (). He had also sustained a displaced femoral shaft fracture. A chest thoracostomy tube was inserted emergently into the right pleural cavity and placed under suction to inflate the lung. Further radiographic studies including computerized tomography images confirmed that the fractured clavicle had penetrated the pleural cavity and caused a partial lung collapse (). The patient was initially placed in a sling for the clavicle fracture to allow access to the thoracostomy site. The patient underwent intramedullary nailing of his femur with a centromedullary device without complication the day of his injury. Due to the magnitude of displacement of the clavicle fracture, it was thought that achieving union with nonoperative modalities would be problematic.

One of the 5 proximal locking screws was removed using the standard screwdriver. Rest of the proximal screws were stripped headed. For their extraction we used the AO synthes screw extraction kit along with conical extraction screw (AO Synthes) but the screws did not come out. The carbide drill was not available at that time. We then decided to proceed with the new technique. The rest of the proximal screws were removed using a technique not previously described. We used stainless steel metal cutting blades that are used to cut door locks or pad locks to cut the remaining stripped headed screws. Firstly, after exposing the plate to be removed a space is created between locking plate and bone adjacent to screws to be cut with the help of sharp osteotome. Then an iron cutting blade which was previously autoclaved introduced between plate and bone adjacent to screws to be cut and with to and fro motion all the remaining screws were cut.

The right ventricle size was normal and there was no evidence of pulmonary hypertension. After placement of standard monitors and preoxygenation of the patient, midazolam, fentanyl and rocuronium were administered. The patient was then intubated and maintenance of anesthesia was achieved using 1 % sevoflurane along with a continuous infusion of remifentanil. Subsequently, an arterial line was placed and a central venous catheter and a sheath for a PA catheter were inserted in the right internal jugular vein. The patient showed stable hemodynamics throughout the insertion of the catheters.\nDuring insertion of the PA catheter, we monitored the pressure waveform from the distal catheter port. The catheter was advanced to the right ventricle at a depth of 40 cm, then, was further advanced to the pulmonary artery at a depth of 55 cm. However, it was relatively easy to drop back the catheter to the right ventricle. Even after several attempts, no stable pulmonary artery waveform was obtained. We then discovered that the distal and proximal ports presented the same waveform pattern. We made the range of the two pressure lines the same and then realized that the two waveforms were completely identical (Fig. ).\nWe first suspected a mechanical problem with the catheter itself such as communication between lumens, so we flushed saline in each lumen. This changed each waveform independently, thus, communication between lumens seemed to be unlikely. Although we tried to remove the catheter, it was firmly in place at 15 cm depth. Flushing of cold saline through the distal port and placement of a guide wire were not successful in attempts to remove the catheter.

The patient had an uneventful post operative course and was followed up for six months without recurrence.\nThe specimen grossly revealed 29 × 20 × 15 cm mass with marked congestion and a multinodular external surface, while the cut section revealed a multicystic mass with solid areas. Segment of large intestine measuring 5 cm was attached to it with no kidney identified grossly. Microsections showed a biphasic (epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation) malignant tumor with solid and cystic components infiltrating through the wall of the adherent bowel. However, the resection margins were free from the tumor. One of the sections showed a small amount of residual renal"}

The patient stated that the mass began as a very small \"bump\" that she believed was a cyst. One year prior she had been evaluated by her primary care physician who described a bulging, red breast mass in the upper outer quadrant which measured at least 8 cm. Core biopsies were performed and the pathology revealed a high-grade malignant neoplasm with dominant features of carcinoma and a suggestion of carcinosarcoma. The patient chose to not undergo treatment and allowed the mass to enlarge with resultant ulceration of the mass through the skin with centralized necrosis and bleeding of the mass. The patient's associated symptoms included a 50 pound weight loss over the previous 6 months with intermittent low-grade fevers.\nThe patient's past medical history was significant for hypertension and left ear deafness. No significant surgical history was reported and her family history was not significant for malignancies in any first degree relatives. Physical examination revealed a cachetic female in significant pain with a large, extensively necrotic mass on the right anterolateral breast and chest wall. The necrotic tissue was on an erythematous, dense mound of tissue that extended to the lateral and central chest wall. No cervical, supraclavicular, left axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy was appreciated on physical exam. There was palpable lymphadenopathy within the right axilla.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room and underwent a right radical mastectomy. This encompassed removal of the entire pectoralis major and minor musculature down to the right chest wall, and a complete level III axillary lymph node dissection was performed. The skin flaps were viable, not grossly involved with tumor, and were able to be closed primarily (Figure ). The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged two days later.

History revealed that the patient was apparently alright 2 years back, when he first noticed a small pea nut size ulcerative growth over left lower eyelid near medial canthus. The growth was painless and persistent in growth. It was not associated with any kind of pain or fever. Initially eye site was normal but as the growth increased his vision started to diminish from left eye due to the increase in the size of growth, approximately 1 year before patient completely loses his vision from left eye. Only due to his extremely poor economic conditions he could not seek any sort of medical treatment.\nOn clinical examination the growth extended superoinferiorly from supraorbital ridge to ipsilateral alae of nose and mesiodistally from right inner canthus of eye to left side of maxillary buttress crossing midline (). Personal history was negative for any detrimental habits. On palpation superficial cervical nodes were not palpable. The growth was ulcerative, exophytic, and fungating and exudates were present. It was approximately 6 × 5 cms in size. The vision from right eye was normal and ocular movements in all directions were intact. All other parameters were within normal range. HR-CT scan was advised. The axial and coronal sections showed large homogenous mass covering the whole left orbit involving the globe but no erosive damage was seen in any of the bony structures (). Correlating the clinical history, examination, and radiological findings a provisional diagnosis of carcinoma of left lower eyelid was suggested. Incisional biopsy was performed and histopathological report revealed dermal invasion by abnormal cells from the epidermis, pleomorphism of the tumour cells with presence of keratinization within the cells which give the cells abundant pink cytoplasm, and intraepithelial keratin in the shape of a whorl which confirmed the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of lower eyelid involving the whole of the eye ().

The patient had a history of child birth eight months prior, and had proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on the left common femoral vein during the 36th week of pregnancy. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter had been inserted instead of anticoagulation due to the high risk of bleeding during pregnancy. Anticoagulation therapy was administered immediately after the birth of her child. Removal of the IVC filter was recommended one month after insertion, but the patient refused for personal reasons. On arriving at the emergency room, her vital signs were stable and the laboratory examination did not show abnormalities other than mild leukocytosis. The patient's prothrombin time international normalized ratio value at the emergency room was 1.31 due to irregular intake of warfarin. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed that one of the IVC filter legs had penetrated the IVC wall and caused a duodenal perforation (). There was no evidence of thrombi in the lower IVC. An endoscopy was performed to evaluate the severity of duodenal injury. A protruding IVC filter leg was observed in the lumen of the third portion of the duodenum (). In addition, the duodenum mucous membrane on the opposite side showed erythema, erosion, and nodular changes, resembling chronically progressing penetration.\nAn emergency laparotomy was performed in order to remove the IVC filter and to repair the duodenum. Because there were concerns regarding the possible IVC rupture during surgery, a cannula was placed in the superior vena cava to provide extracorporeal circulation when needed. Also, the femoral artery and femoral vein were isolated for cannulation. The portions of the IVC and the duodenum, including the penetrations, were isolated behind the colon. When the duodenum was lifted up, we found the IVC filter leg between the IVC and the duodenum. We then cut the IVC filter leg and removed the IVC filter leg remnant from the duodenum portion. The duodenal perforation was repaired directly. The IVC"}

Upon acceleration, she experienced severe pain on both thighs and fell down. She continued to suffer from severe pain on the anterior surface of her thighs and tenderness with any attempt of movement. She was also unable to stand up and walk. Her trainer observed swelling and loss of function immediately after the trauma and he tried to control the pain with compression dressing and ice packs while they were in the field. She was later brought to our clinic by an ambulance.\nOn physical examination, an oedema was found on the anterior surface of her thighs. The pain was continuous and aggravated on palpation of the quadriceps muscle and any knee movement. There was no gap in quadriceps continuity. Her active and passive knee flexion and extension were restricted and painful. She was not able to perform an isometric quadriceps contraction with her knee in full extension. The active knee's range of movement was 40° for the right and 55° for the left. The passive range of movement was the same because of the pain. We checked the pulse of her periphery arteries with a Doppler ultrasound machine and we found it normal. After the physical examination a roentgenogram was performed. The roentgenogram result was negative for fracture and the patella was not displaced.\nUltrasonography revealed haematoma formation on both her rectus femoris muscles, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was then performed to estimate the size of the haematomas and to evaluate the surrounding soft tissues (Figure , Figure , Figure ). The diameters of the left and right haematomas within the muscles were 6 cm and 5 cm, respectively.\nBased on physical and MRI examinations the strains were classified as second grade or moderate.

Past history revealed that the patient had met with a motor vehicle accident 3 months ago and was subsequently treated for fracture of the mandible on the right side. Extra oral examination revealed an obvious swelling of 1 × 1.5 cm in size on the right side of the mandibular region with the overlying skin showing a crusty appearance []. There was a sinus opening along with pus discharge over the swelling. Intra oral examination revealed inter dental wiring done from 73 till 83 []. Dental abnormalities included missing 31, rotation of 41, 42 and 32; anterior open bite and posterior open bite on the left side. Orthopantomogram revealed presence of bone plate along with 4 screws in the region of 43 and 45, which were in close approximation with the developing roots of 43 and 45 and the plate was oriented in an oblique direction []. A fracture line on the right side of the mandible extending from interdental area of 42 and 83 vertically and horizontally along the lower border of the mandible was also observed on this radiograph. There was a step deformity in the lower border of the mandible indicating improperly reduced fracture. An associated malunion of the subcondylar fracture on the left side was also noted []. Based on history, clinical features, and radiographic features this case was diagnosed as malunited fractures of the body and the condyle of the mandible on the opposite sides.

While dancing the quick-step (an energetic and form-intensive style) she externally rotated about a planted right foot and felt an acute pain in her right knee with her patella shifting laterally. On arrival at hospital her right leg was locked in full extension and she was in severe pain. The patient had no history of previous knee trauma, prior dislocations, or joint hypermobility. She has no other past medical history to suggest any cause for dislocation of the patella. In particular she had no history of paediatric lower limb alignment problems that would predispose her to a dislocated patella. On inspection of the limb there was a deformity of her right patella indicative of a rare patellar dislocation (Figures and ). The patella appeared rotated on its vertical axis and the skin over the knee joint was tented. It was fixed in position. There was a mild joint effusion and no joint line tenderness. Her range of motion at the right knee was significantly reduced with any flexion from full extension causing the patient significant pain. She was able to straight leg raise on examination indicating that her extensor mechanism was intact. The limb was otherwise neurovascularly intact. The examination of the contralateral limb was entirely normal.\nThe AP radiograph revealed a laterally dislocated patella. The lateral radiograph showed an abnormal appearance with the rotated patella impacted in the intercondylar notch of the femur (Figures and ). In the accident and emergency department one unsuccessful attempt at closed reduction was made under procedural sedation with propofol and fentanyl. The knee joint was fully extended and an attempt was made to manipulate the patella to rotate it back to its normal orientation.\nUnder a general anaesthetic with muscle relaxant the patella was successfully relocated using a closed technique.

A diagnostic image of her brain showed minimal changes such as mild brain edema, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed lymphocyte pleocytosis suggesting inflammatory changes. As the first presumptive diagnosis was either viral encephalitis or autoimmune encephalitis, intravenous high dose steroids, acyclovir, and glycerol were administrated. Several days after her admission, she also showed involuntary movements, disturbance of consciousness, and central hypoventilation; she was managed by assisted respiration and medicated with midazolam and propofol. Since autoimmune encephalitis was the most possible diagnosis according to further examinations, plasma exchange treatment was also started, and the patient was introduced to our department for examination for a potential ovarian teratoma. Nevertheless, neither internal examination nor transvaginal ultrasonography detected an ovarian teratoma. T1-weighted pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 5 × 7 mm fat intensity in the right ovary that showed the possibility of a teratoma (). T2-weighted pelvic MRI showed that a large number of similar-sized ovarian follicles surrounded the teratoma (). Initially, abdominal computed tomography (CT) with 10 mm slice thickness did not detect any fatty component in the right ovary. However, by referencing to the MRI findings, CT with 1 mm slice thickness eventually detected the fatty component in the right ovary. The mean CT number of that showed −62.5 HU (Figures and ).\nAfter 18 days from the first visit to our hospital, the patient underwent a laparoscopic operation for complete resection of the right ovarian teratoma.

{"note": "A 56-year-old male patient, whose plasmacytoma was enucleated 3 years ago from the medial side of the left mandible, was referred to our clinic due to his complaints of persistent orocutaneous fistula (Figures –). Past medical history revealed that the patient was operated three times to close the orocutaneous fistula by local flaps; however, none of these operations were successful. CT images of the patient demonstrated that the medial side of the left mandible was missing and there was a 3 × 2 cm diameter defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland. The main reason of the failed attempts to close the fistula was considered to be the ineffective management of dead space surrounding the fistula. Consequently, it was decided to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect and support the oral and the cutaneous flaps.\nUnder general anesthesia, the fistula was excised initially and the oral and the cutaneous healthy soft tissues were prepared. At the extraoral site, the incision was extended to the posterior and anterior directions, following the previous incision lines. In the subplatysmal plane, the superficial layer of the neck fascia was dissected to reach the base of the mandible. After the dissection of the fascia, the submandibular gland and the base of the mandible were exposed, the soft tissues surrounding the submandibular gland were dissected, and the gland was mobilized by protecting the arteriovenous supply and the duct. At the oral site, the margins of the wound were released by blunt dissection and were closed by mattress sutures via 5/0 polypropylene. Following the mobilization of the gland, a soft tissue tunnel was prepared between the submandibular space and the defect area and the submandibular gland was rotated by passing the gland through the soft tissue tunnel by preserving the pedicle (). The rotated gland was sutured to the recipient site with 3/0 reabsorbable polyglaction sutures for the stabilization. At the cutaneous site, the flap was closed"}

She was also allergic to numerous drugs and diagnostic agents (e.g., contrast media, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and sodium valproate). She visited the department of surgery at our hospital with chief complaints of appetite loss, nausea, and vomiting that had persisted for the prior two weeks. Because abdominal plain computed tomography (CT) revealed ileus and an abdominal incisional hernia, she was immediately admitted with a diagnosis of ileus caused by the incisional hernia. Moreover, a tumor measuring 21 cm in longest diameter was detected in the pelvis (). She was thus referred to our department for detailed examination and treatment. At the initial examination, the abdomen was soft without tenderness, rebound tenderness, or muscular defense. An easily movable mass extending from the right lower abdomen to the level of the umbilicus was palpated. The patient had undergone omental implantation for acute perforated gastric ulcer 10 years earlier. Preoperative abdominal plain CT had revealed a right ovarian tumor measuring 6 cm in diameter (), which contained a part of calcification and fatty components; however, there had been no findings suggestive of malignancy, such as a solid component or a mural nodule. The right ovarian tumor was radiologically diagnosed with a mature cystic teratoma. After surgery for the acute perforated gastric ulcer, she had not been referred to the department of gynecology. No further examination of the right ovarian tumor was performed. She had not been followed up for the ovarian tumor.

On admission he was conscious and well orientated with normal vital signs. His right shoulder and arm were painful, swollen and deformed. Clinical examination revealed a closed and neurovascular intact injury that had resulted to angulation of the arm with loss of the normal contour of the shoulder.\nRadiographs showed an anterior dislocation of the shoulder with a transverse fracture of the middle third of the humeral shaft on the same side (Figure ). The arm was temporarily immobilized in a plaster slab. We have not performed a Magnetic Resonance scan (MRI) in order to investigate possible rotator cuff pathology, because of the lack of MRI equipment in our hospital. Thus, we decided that clinical examination at later would indicate the need or not of MRI. As soon as the secondary clinical survey was completed the patient was carried to the operating theatre. Under general anaesthesia, repeated attempts for closed reduction of the dislocated shoulder failed. Strong muscle contraction, despite the induction of muscle relaxation agents by the anesthetists, and extensive swelling of the soft tissues were obstructive of a successful reduction. Because of the unstable state of the fractured humerus and the risk for further soft tissue compromise and iatrogenic neurovascular damage, it was decided not to insist on reduction maneuvers. The surgeons preferred to attempt stabilization of the shaft fracture by intramedullary nailing prior to the reduction. Under fluoroscopy the entry point was targeted on the dislocated humeral head and an incision was made on the overlying skin. Although the anatomy of the region was altered, because of the dislocation, the anteriorly placed humeral head in the subcoracoid space facilitated, rather than obstructed, the guide wire and nail insertion. Intraoperative investigation revealed no rotator cuff or biceps pathology. Unfortunately a typical intramedullary nailing procedure could not be completed because after the proximal locking screw insertion, the image intensifier equipment suffered serious damage. The"}

The ear was lost as a consequence of a road traffic accident a few years ago. The patient was initially attempted for surgical reconstructing of the artificial ear using cartilage and alloplastic graft materials. As the reconstruction did not provide pleasing esthetics, it was later removed, and the patient was referred for prosthetic replacement of the missing ear. After due examination and obtaining patient's informed consent, two implants' supported custom silicone auricular prosthesis was agreed upon as the best treatment modality for the patient. Presurgical cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans were made with a radiographic stent with radio-opaque markers in different probable implant positions. The scans were used to assess the proximity of dura, sigmoid sinuses, and any other limiting anatomical structure from the planned implant positions. The same radiographic stent was modified and converted into a surgical stent to conform to the planned implant sites. Two dental implants were placed at sites 11:30 and 9:30 o'clock positions at approximately 20 mm distance from the center of the external auditory meatus.[] Thinning out of the basal tissue bed was also carried out in the same surgical appointment taking into consideration the presence of residual graft material from the previous reconstruction procedure lying in the tissue bed. The implants were left to heal for 3 months. Despite the attempted thinning of the tissue bed, fresh CBCT scans revealed the tissue thickness from the top of the implant surface to the external skin surface to be in the range of 7–11 mm over both the implants at various sites []. Only custom made healing abutment of a height higher than 11 mm could prove useful in maintaining the patency of the passage from the external skin surface to the implant chamber and prevent tissues from sagging in as they heal postsurgical exposure.

According to the vascular surgery operative report, the procedure was completed successfully through access of the bilateral femoral arteries and the left brachial artery (). After the procedure, there was no immediate recognition of any major complications other than a small contained hematoma at the brachial catheter insertion site that formed after withdrawal of the catheter.\nThe patient then presented to our outpatient pain management clinic 2 months following the procedure with symptoms of atrophy and weakness of the left forearm and pain in the left hand. During the initial examination, a pulsatile mass of 2–4 cm was palpated in the medial left upper arm in the antecubital fossa. Motor assessment of the upper extremities revealed bilateral biceps flexion/extension 4/5, left finger flexion 2/5, and left hand grip 2/5. The patient's presentation was concerning for an aneurysm of the left brachial artery. An immediate ultrasound of the left upper extremity was ordered and revealed a pseudoaneurysm of the left brachial artery. The patient was urgently referred to vascular surgery and was taken to the operating room to repair the pseudoaneurysm the following day.\nFour months after repair of the pseudoaneurysm, the patient returned to our clinic and his left upper extremity sequelae worsened. He now demonstrated significant guarding of his left hand and allodynia to the median nerve distribution and had skin changes and contracture of his digits with significant weakness and atrophy.

He had had the proximal intramedullary nail screw removed 3 months prior to presentation due to discomfort but reported no other medical problems. On exam, there was significant swelling of the ankle, with global tenderness to palpation. The fibula was noted to be displaced, as palpation of the lateral aspect of the ankle resulted in contact with the tibia, and palpation at the normal region of the peroneal groove revealed the distal fibula. Motion of the ankle was limited in all planes; however, the foot was neurovascularly intact and sensitive to light touch. A 3-view X-ray of the ankle confirmed the dislocation of the fibula posterior to the tibia and posterior dislocation of the talus, while showing the stable intramedullary nail and distal screw with no apparent lucencies (). Additionally, AP and lateral views of the entire tibia and fibula did not reveal any fractures, and the patient did not complain of any discomfort or tenderness to palpation outside of the ankle. Closed reduction was attempted in the emergency department; the talus was relocated, but the fibula was lodged in place and unable to be reduced. Understanding that repeated attempts at closed reduction most likely be unsuccessful and to minimize the risk of articular damage, iatrogenic fracture, or skin breakdown, the decision was made to proceed with open reduction. The patient consented to open reduction and internal fixation of the fibular dislocation and was taken to the operating room the same day. The time that elapsed from injury to operation start was just under 5 hours. From the time the patient had been seen in the emergency department to operation start was under 3 hours.

CT finding suggested the highly possibility of right adnexal tumor. The patient underwent laparoscopic exploration for treatment of this tumor. However, there was no definite abnormality on both adnexae and uterus grossly and the retroperitoneal mass on right side of uterus was detected in the operative field. The patient was referred to our institution for further evaluation and definitive treatment of right retroperitoneal pelvic mass. She had no previous medical illness except surgical history of appendectomy 22 years ago. Abdominal and vaginal examination revealed non-specific findings without palpation of abdominal mass and the laboratory findings are within normal limit including tumor marker.\nAbdominal ultrasonography revealed the right adnexal mass with echogenicity and this mass was abutting to uterus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated 8 cm-sized, enhancing mass attached to right adnexa and the uterus. This mass had the low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and heterogeneous, high signal intensity on T2-weighted images (). Because the previous laparoscopic exploration was negative for abnormality of right ovary, the ovarian tumor was excluded on diagnosis of the patient. Other possible diagnosis on MRI finding was mesenchymal sarcoma because the tumor had similar intensity to the muscle of uterus meaning originated from muscle but it looked like as separate from the uterus. Based on the imaging findings, the patient was diagnosed preoperatively as mesenchymal sarcoma on pelvic cavity and exploratory laparotomy was planned for removal the pelvic mass.\nAfter laparotomy via lower midline incision, the careful examination of pelvic cavity was performed.

The maxillary right second molar was extracted and immediately placed into the recipient site. It was stabilized with 4-0 silk sutures and a semi-rigid resin wire splint (). The extra-oral time from extraction of the maxillary right second molar to transplantation was 11 minutes. Amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day and Ibuprofen 400 mg three times a day were prescribed for a week, and a 0.1% chlorhexidine rinse was used for 7 days.\nThe root canal therapy was begun 2 weeks later. After the calcium hydroxide dressing was maintained for 2 weeks, root canal therapy was completed at 4 weeks after the surgery.\nAt the 7 month follow up, there was no clinical symptom or radiographic signs of root resorption (). As planned, the regenerative periodontal surgery was done on the maxillary right second premolar which had deep periodontal pocket. A new bone formation around the bifurcation area of the transplanted tooth was confirmed during the surgery (). The autotransplanted tooth will be restored with a full crown.

The pregnancy had not been complicated. The mother had not had any diseases or taken any drugs or herbal medications. There was no family history of congenital heart disease. Obstetric evaluation showed normal fetal growth, normal amount of amniotic fluid and normal placenta. The fetal echocardiography revealed the normal four chamber view, where two atria and two ventricles were normal in size and thickness (). The two atrioventricular valves moved normally. Two great arteries arose normally from the appropriate ventricles. The pulmonary and aortic valves looked normal and the size of the main pulmonary artery and aortic root was within normal limits. The aortic arch was normal in size and in location, but the ductal arch was not visualized in any views. The main pulmonary artery bifurcated into two branch pulmonary arteries but was not continuous with the DA (). However color Doppler examination showed a tortuous 'S' shaped ductus cuddled inside the aortic arch (). The DA joined the descending aorta with an obtuse angle and showed a flow signal from the main pulmonary artery to the descending aorta (). Color aliasing occurred along the course of the ductus but pulsed Doppler measurement of velocity was not attempted because of the poor angle of insonation. Flow velocity and waveforms of the two great arteries were within normal limits and no TR was found. A diagnosis of S-shaped DA with mild narrowing was made and follow up examination was arranged.\nA repeat examination was performed at 27 weeks of gestation and showed nearly the same findings as before. The RV was normal in size and thickness and no TR was noted. Because the DA was S-shaped, it was very difficult to assess size along the whole range of the DA. However, the color Doppler examination showed tortuous turbulent flow in the ductus and suggested mild obstruction. The sagittal section of the aortic arch"}

On presentation at our department, he described his symptoms as constant boring pain not being altered by activity or rest whereas increasing at night and in the early morning. Physical exam showed a painful and restricted cervical spine motion. No sensory and motor deficits in the upper limbs were noted. General physical examination and laboratory investigations were normal. Past medical history revealed a heart attack 28 years ago and a 40 pack-year history of cigarette smoking. No regular medications were taken. He presented recent X-ray pictures showing a multi-level degeneration of cervical spine and 7-months-old MRI images showing cervical disc protrusion C4 to C7 and neuroforaminal stenosis with compression of the C6 nerve root considered to be the reason for his pain. As conservative treatment was ineffective, performance of spondylodesis and spinal decompression C5 - C7 was advised.\nA neurological examination and a closer look at the patient's detailed pain history revealed that the abovementioned complaints could not be completely explained by the spinal stenosis. Therefore, new MRI scan was requested. An osteolysis of the odontoid process highly suspicious for metastasis was seen. CT scan of the cervical spine confirmed no compromise of odontoid process stability so that a pathologic fracture of the vertebra with possible severe consequences for the patient was not expected. Complete tumor staging with abdominal and thoracic CT scans and skeleton scintigraphy was performed. A coin lesion suspicious of bronchial carcinoma in the right lung and further pancreatic and adrenal lesions consistent with metastases were discovered. Further bony metastases could not be revealed. The histological examination of the tissue obtained in bronchoscopy displayed dense infiltrates of a large cell undifferentiated carcinoma in the right upper pulmonary lobe. Following the decision of the interdisciplinary tumor board, the patient was treated with palliative radiochemotherapy. This alleviated the patient's neck pain and headache.

She noted that she had worsening symptoms over the course of one week but no prior history of similar events. The patient denied any trauma to the digit. She underwent an incision and drainage of what was diagnosed clinically as a paronychia. Cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus and she received IV antibiotics. The patient was discharged in stable condition with resolution of her symptoms.\nShe then presented four months later with pain along the radial aspect of her thumb with scant serous drainage from the lateral nail fold. She also pointed out the presence of a small amount of granulomatous tissue, which was subsequently resolved. She was followed conservatively and the drainage ceased. She continued to note occasional pain in the radial aspect of her nail fold as well as the interphalangeal joint. At this time, she was found to have what appeared to be a nail deformity (). The patient was taken to the operating room for a biopsy. The biopsy specimen was notable for moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma as well as pyogenic granuloma.\nThe cells showed nuclear pleomorphism, atypia, with increased abnormal mitoses and areas of keratin formation. The patient subsequently underwent re-excision of the nail bed, nail fold, and bone in the biopsy area with local flap reconstruction. Margins of the resection were measured 5 mm from the biopsy incision.\nTwo focal areas of squamous cell carcinoma were noted in the bony segment on final pathology (~). The patient subsequently returned to the operating room for an amputation at the interphalangeal joint of the thumb.

Workup in the way of liver function tests and abdominal ultrasound did not demonstrate evidence suggesting biliary or gallbladder pathology, and as such she was discharged home. She represented within hours of discharge due to worsening symptoms. She therefore underwent evaluation with a computed tomography that demonstrated a soft tissue mass located posterior to the gallbladder (). The patient then underwent further evaluation with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Again, a complex cystic structure of indeterminate etiology was observed at the porta hepatis without evidence of communication with either the biliary or vascular structures. At the time, the differential diagnosis included a ruptured hepatic adenoma, biliary cystic lesion, or enteric cyst.\nSecondary to these findings and her persistent symptoms the patient was taken to the operating room. At the time of laparoscopy a hemorrhagic pedunculated mass was identified attached to the infundibulum of the gallbladder once the fundus was retracted in a cephalad direction (). It was easily dissected off the hilar structures by blunt dissection and then resected by ligating a small pedicle of tissue connecting this mass to the gallbladder infundibulum near the cystic duct by using a harmonic scalpel. There was also a considerable amount of inflammation to the infundibulum of the gallbladder in proximity to this hemorrhagic mass with the remainder appearing normal. Therefore, a cholecystectomy was performed as well. We believe the cholecystitis was secondary to inflammation from the hemorrhagic mass. As mentioned previously, her initial ultrasound did not show any evidence of cholecystitis. Even though one could expect this inflammation to resolve once the hemorrhagic mass was removed, we decided to perform a cholecystectomy because there was considerable dissection within the region of the cystic duct and the concern of potential ischemia and stricture did exist.\nThe patient's postoperative course was uneventful and her symptoms resolved immediately.

Her medical history was notable for prior deep vein thrombus in the right distal lower extremity while on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). She denied the active use of HRT and tobacco use during this admission. Venous Doppler ultrasound completed in the emergency room revealed extensive thrombosis of the left lower extremity extending superiorly towards the left common iliac vein. Further imaging with ultrasound revealed compression of the left iliac vein by the right iliac artery as well as a significantly elevated reflux time of the left great saphenous vein (14.2 seconds) suggestive of MTS. The patient was taken to the operating suite and during the procedure the common iliac vein appeared normal distally, but more proximally the vein was narrowed significantly to a diameter of less than 2 mm. Prior to entering the inferior vena cava, the common iliac vein normalized. Using intravenous ultrasound, measurements were taken and a 14 x 60 mm Luminexx stent was deployed at the area of stenosis. The stent was noted to have migrated upward into the inferior vena cava and a buttressing of this stent with a 16 x 40 mm Wallstent was placed to ensure adequate apposition. Unfortunately, this caused further migration upward into the IVC and a 14 mm Atlas balloon was used to help secure the migrated IVC stent. The area of stenosis was no longer stented given this migration. Therefore, stenting of the left common iliac vein stenosis was ultimately achieved with a 14 x 80 mm Luminexx stent (). The patient was started on warfarin with heparin bridging postoperatively. Early ambulation and the routine use of elastic stockings were encouraged following the procedure. The following day the patient complained of severe abdominal pain and an abdominal x-ray revealed only two stents located in the abdomen ().

The family history was unremarkable and the mother's medical history nonsignificant except for the presence of two intramural uterine myomas diagnosed before the current pregnancy and smaller than 47 mm in maximum diameter in previous control one year before gestation.\nOur ultrasound investigation verified the presence of an intramural-submucosal tumor with a muscular echogenic pattern and a size of 110 × 88 mm in the anterior uterine wall near to the internal cervical os and another intramural one with a size of 28 × 21 mm in the uterine fundus. Fetus presented a normal heart rate pattern and was observed with absent movements and displaced to the right uterine wall in an abnormal position, with hyperextension of head and strongly flexed lower limbs (). Fetal measures according to the gestational age and the amount of amniotic fluid were normal. On the basis of these findings, the diagnosis of arthrogryposis secondary to fetal akinesia due to giant leiomyoma was done.\nAccording to the Spanish legislation, the parents decided the elective termination of pregnancy. A vaginal delivery was induced with local prostaglandins without complications. At the time of birth, the fetus had not cardiac activity and showed external male genitals, a weight of 105 g and a length of 125 mm. His position consisted of internal rotation of the shoulders and stiffness of the limbs with symmetrically flexed and fixed elbows and wrists and severe equinovarus deformities of the feet ().\nThe pathology report concluded that internal organs of the fetus did not present abnormalities.

Initially after fall, he was suggested surgical treatment but he choose to go with conservative treatment. Even after one year of conservative treatment in the form of rehabilitation programme with gait training, balance exercises and proper counseling against fall prevention, patient had negligible improvement. After one year of injury, the patient was operated at another centre wherein anterior C5 cervical corpectomy with mesh cage, bone grafting, and anterior cervical plating was done.\nAfter surgery, although neurological status of the patient remained the same but was otherwise doing well, only to return after 1.5 months of primary surgery with mild neck pain which was insidious in onset, non-progressive in nature, aggravated by activity and relieved with rest with no diurnal variation and no associated systemic symptoms. An radiograph of the cervical spine done within three days of neck pain showed loosening and back out of upper screws of the anterior cervical plate (). A total of 2.5 months after the primary surgery, there was sudden onset difficulty in swallowing, more for solid foods with associated pain in the throat. There was no history suggestive of trauma, fever, respiratory difficulty, local swelling or wound discharge. The symptoms progressed for the next 2 to 3 days after which dysphagia resolved. However, odynophagia persisted to some extent and gradually resolved in the next 2-3 weeks. Repeat radiograph of the cervical spine immediately after throat pain showed that one of the proximal screws was missing along with completely backed out plate ().

This finding necessitated further evaluation by a chest radiograph.\nThe patient was hemodynamically stable upon arrival and not in distress. He had normal oxygen saturation and a normal head and neck examination. Examination of the lungs revealed mild crackles over lung bases but with no evidence of stridor or hoarseness.\nUpon questioning, the mother reported that he had been having vague upper respiratory symptoms with food regurgitation and frequent vomiting over the past seven months. She denied solid food dysphagia but reported mild daily drooling. These symptoms were progressively worsening over the past four months. He was initially diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease and treated with prokinetics and proton pump inhibitors, to which he responded only minimally.\nA chest radiograph was done in the emergency room showing the presence of a round metallic density over the topography of the upper esophagus showing irregular contour, with mild mass effect on the left aspect of the trachea (). The lung fields appeared clear. Further evaluation by a CT scan showed the same round metallic object at the level of the upper esophagus (). A barium swallow was performed and showed that the patient was swallowing without difficulty, with the foreign body apparently separate from the esophageal tract.\nThe decision was made to perform an esophagoscopy in the operating room to the attempt of foreign body removal. Intraoperatively, the foreign body was not seen but a hard mass was felt at the lateral esophageal wall, which was covered by granulation tissue.

On examination, he was drowsy and disoriented with a Glasgow Coma Scale 8/15 and found to be hemodynamically unstable. Physical examination of the extremities revealed a flexed and adducted right hip with the right knee flexed to 30° and with posterior dislocation (). Neurovascular examination revealed common peroneal nerve palsy and absent distal pulses. However, the Doppler showed weak signals over posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery, and the toes were found to be warm with delayed capillary filling. Computed tomography (CT) brain showed acute hemorrhagic contusion. Radiographs showed a posterior dislocation of the right hip and posterior dislocation of right knee with comminuted fracture right distal tibia ().\nThe patient was intubated and hemodynamically stabilized and immediate closed reduction was attempted. The Firstly, an ankle spanning exfix was applied to address the distal tibial fracture, and the knee dislocation was reduced by gentle traction given to the leg. Further traction on the right hip with the hip in 90° flexion with an assistant stabilizing the pelvis reduced the right hip dislocation, which was found to be stable after reduction. Then, ankle spanning external fixator extended to span the knee. Immediately following the procedure, distal pulses were clinically not palpable but relatively good flow was noted in the Doppler both in the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery.

No other member of the family was similarly affected. His mouth opening was normal until he met with a trauma with wooden thorn on the left cheek region. Thorn was removed by a surgeon immediately, but the patient had progressively reduced mouth opening since then. Computed tomography scan showed a radiodense mass extending in front of the anterior border of the ramus of the mandible, suggestive of ossified masseter muscle []. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed evidence of a large elongated T1–T2 intermediate signal intensity lesion with mild surrounding edema in the substance of left masseter muscle, abutting the ramus of left mandible likely to represent heterotopic bone formation (at the expected location of previous surgery for thorn extraction) []. This finding along with a history of trauma led us to the diagnosis of MOT.\nOn thorough probing into the history, the patient's father said that the patient had a history of pain and swelling in the left thigh region and limited movement of the left leg 3 years back when he was only 2 years old.

His symptoms were initially explained by anxiety from the planned procedure. In few days time, he developed severe localized pain on the right lower costal area that radiates from the spine forward to the mid abdomen. He noticed mild change in the color of the skin in this area with redness, small vesicular rash, and soreness. These gradually improved with symptomatic treatment for herpes zoster. By the end of the second week, he started to feel heaviness of the right leg and numbness on the left. There were no urinary symptoms or fever.

Overlying skin was normal and no regional lymph nodes were palpable.\nMammography of the left breast revealed a 15-mm lesion in the upper outer quadrant and on core biopsy it was shown to be a grade I invasive ductal carcinoma which was oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive. On the right side, the first mass, an area of about 13-mm of micro calcification, was situated in the upper outer quadrant at the 10'o clock position, and on core biopsy was confirmed as a grade I invasive ductal carcinoma, also both oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive. The second mass was at the 11'o clock position and the third was in the lower inner quadrant and these latter two lesions on core biopsy showed lymphoma-like features but not breast carcinoma. The core biopsies were therefore sent for expert opinion but this supplementary report was also not conclusive. Therefore, diagnostic excision biopsy was recommended. In the meantime, staging computerised tomography of her chest and abdomen was performed and was found to be normal. Treatment options were then openly discussed with the patient and her family and she opted for a right mastectomy and axillary node clearance and wide local excision and axillary node sampling on the left.

Her past surgical history was also significant for a hysterectomy and unilateral oophorectomy, which were performed to address a fibroid and benign ovarian cyst more than 17 years prior to this presentation. Her past medical history was significant for diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and acid reflux. Her current presentation was that of a recent, progressive gluteal swelling associated with chronic lower back pain, which has progressed in the few months prior to presentation. Upon presentation, a cystic mass was felt in the gluteal area and needle aspiration was attempted.

A review of the slides at another private tertiary hospital revealed a mucinous adenocarcinoma; primary ovarian or cervical primaries were to be excluded.\nA review of the slides was performed at our hospital. The microscopic description was that of an invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, as evident throughout the provided tissue samples. The mucin had extravasated to the surrounding tissue and elicited a histiocytic reaction (). The tumor was seen at the margin and reached the skin’s surface with ulceration. Features"}

Next day morning, about 12 hours after the injury, child developed weakness involving right side of the face, right arm, and the right leg. Child was unable to sit or stand. On examination child was conscious and active showing decreased movements in the right half of the body with muscle power 2/5 in both right upper and lower extremity along with right sided UMN type of facial palsy, with a positive Babinski sign on the same side. There were no signs of raised intracranial pressure or meningeal irritation. Other neurological examinations were normal. Child did not have any signs suggestive of nonaccidental injury and did not have any external signs of trauma to the head or elsewhere on the body. Child had no clinical history suggestive of varicella, measles, or ear discharge in the past. There was no history of feeding difficulty which suggests that there was no lower cranial nerve involvement. Perinatal history was uneventful. There were no significant family history suggestive of thromboembolic disorders and no history of recent vaccination. Investigations like routine blood count, peripheral smear, serum electrolytes, bleeding, and coagulation profile were done and found to be within normal limits. MRI brain suggested acute infarct involving the left capsuloganglionic region (Figures and ). Child was managed conservatively with osmotic diuretics to reduce perilesional oedema and also was started on anticoagulant therapy subcutaneously. Low molecular weight heparin was given for a total of 5 days and was stopped without any continuation of oral antiplatelet therapy.

Considering her actual state, the very long distance from hemodialysis centers and the possible opportunity for a future renal transplantation we concluded to start with peritoneal dialysis. Before starting PD we applied several sessions of hemodialysis using a subclavian temporary cathether. Two weeks after the peritoneal cathether implantation she started peritoneal dialysis. She continued on PD for two years but after a grave episode of peritonitis accompanied with a septic state, dialysis failure, long hospitalization, she was transferred urgently to hemodialysis. Her transplantation plans failed because her mother, the only possible donor died from a heart attack. She was maintained on regular HD, but her dialysis care was complicated by recurrent vascular access thrombosis. The first fistula functioned only 3 months and the second, third and fourth fistula were immature and not functioning. Both grafts didn’t function and were clotted till the first days. During this time the catheters were her vascular access of necessity with all the difficulties and hazardous situations that they bring with them. The third graft that was performed in Turkey, was clotted till the first days then was done the thrombectomy and then clotted again. The salvage procedures failed again. During this time the ongoing of hemodialysis was compromised from the recurrent septic states with seizures and bacteremia especially in the first hour of hemodialysis sessions. We usually used the cathether antibiotic locking in the end of hemodialysis with cephazolin or gentamicin but she gradually went on severe malnutrition due to long term infectious states and inefficient hemodialysis. She was supported with parenteral nutrition, more frequent HD sessions and intravenous antibiotics. This long calvary of suffering continued to the extent that only one access site was available for her routine renal replacement treatment.\nA thorough thrombophilia screen confirmed the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, while antinuclear antibody and anti ds-DNA antibodies were negative. A diagnosis of APAS was made and she was anticoagulated"}

She was completely asymptomatic and the physical exam was strictly normal. Endocrinological evaluation was done with normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and no hyper secretion of catecholamines. The patient was considered to have a non-secreting right adrenal mass for which an adrenal scan was done and showed a well encapsulated 10 × 9 × 7 cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass with areas of necrosis and calcifications without local invasion (). The decision of right laparoscopic trans peritoneal adrenalectomy was taken with the patient. The surgery was done under general anesthesia after central and arterial lines insertion, the patient was on left decubitus position. 5 trocars were inserted as follows: The first 12-mm port was inserted at the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle just above the level of the umbilicus to accommodate the camera. Two subcostal 11 mm ports were also placed; one in the midclavicular line and the other in the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle. The forth 5-mm subcostal trocar was inserted in the anterior axillary line to retract the liver and the fifth 5 mm one was inserted in the epigastrium and used specially for aspiration and irrigation. After liver retraction, the peritoneum along the lateral aspect of the IVC was incised to expose the IVC just below its intrahepatic course. The duodenum which was diverted by the mass was mobilized.

She had a thirty pack a year history of tobacco use with current use of tobacco products. She had Charcot's disease of the left lower extremity, amputation below knee of her left lower extremity and required use of wheelchair for ambulation. She underwent creation of left basilic vein to the left brachial artery AVF with a plan to perform a second stage superficialization and transposition 6 weeks later. She denied any complaints in the immediate postoperative period. Physical exam during this visit revealed left arm with good grip strength, radial artery pulse of at least 2, and good thrill in the venous segment of the fistula. She was seen again in the vascular clinic 4 weeks after her surgery with the plan to superficialize her AVF. However, she was now complaining of numbness and mild pain in the left hand which is increased at night. She stated in retrospect that some of these symptoms had started about 4 days after the creation of the fistula. At this point, there was concern for steal syndrome; however, on her exam her hand was pink and warm, and there was still a good radial pulse and a duplex doppler ultrasound revealed good flow in the fistula with no significant reversal of flow and no decreased blood flow in the lower part of the left arm. An electromyogram (EMG) was ordered to evaluate for neurological etiologies to investigate the cause of her left-hand pain. On a subsequent follow-up to the clinic, she was noted to have muscle wasting of the left medial palm and dorsum. Sensation was found to be decreased along the medial aspect of the left arm from the elbow including part of the third, fourth, and fifth digits.

{"note": "An 80-year-old man was admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and a cutaneous lesion with white, purulent discharge that appeared a week ago in the same region. The patient’s medical history was notable for an operation for the removal of a liver abscess of unknown etiology fifteen years ago; otherwise, no other chronic illnesses were present.\nDuring physical examination, the abdominal wall was tender on palpation, and the examination of the lesion in the upper right quadrant revealed a fistula opening with white fluid discharge. The physical examination of other systems was normal. The abdominal ultrasonography performed in the ED showed a cystic mass with a diameter of 6 cm in the seventh and eighth segment: the cyst had a calcified membrane and a comet-tail artifact that indicated the presence of air. The cystic lesion appeared to protrude to the subcapsular area and subcutaneous tissue: these findings were highly suggestive of a fistula. The biochemical values and complete blood counts were within normal limits. An abdominal computed tomography with intravenous contrast revealed a single, calcified, membranous lesion in segments 8 and 4A with a fistula to the abdominal anterior wall (Fig. ). In addition, the increased subcutaneous density within the cyst was noted. Surgical drainage by subcostal incision under local anesthesia resulted in approximately 100 mL of purulent material. The cyst was not excised due to the advanced age of the patient. Nonetheless, bradycardia and hypoglycemia that developed during the postoperative recovery necessitated the patient to be admitted to the intensive care unit for further treatment. Importantly, the analysis of the purulent material from the cyst failed to confirm an Echinococcus infection; however, Klebsiella pneumonia that was susceptible to most commonly used antibiotics was cultured from the purulent material, upon which a 14-day course of ampicillin-sulbactam was initiated. The patient underwent repeated abdominal ultrasonography, which failed to show a recurrence of similar cystic lesions in the abdomen. The patient was discharged 7 days after hospitalization and was followed at the outpatient clinic. The evaluation"}

Having been subject to a preliminary evaluation in our emergency department, the patient was transferred to the gastroenterology clinic for further investigation and treatment, where oral intake was stopped and replaced with parenteral replacement therapy. The patient’s medical background revealed nothing remarkable other than recurrent epigastric pain. He also had a history of receiving proton pump inhibitor drugs on an irregular basis. Upon physical examination, his general clinical status was good, with stable vital parameters. A palpable mass of 5 × 5 cm, along with tenderness in the epigastric region on palpation, was detected during abdominal examination. The laboratory test results, including liver and renal function tests, complete blood count, coagulation profiles and tumor markers were within normal limits. Upper GIS endoscopy revealed a submucosally located mass lesion of dense vascularity at the antrum-corpus junction on the greater gastric curvature. The appearance of the mass evoked the impression of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor of mesenchymal origin (). Accordingly, a biopsy was taken from this area. No definite focus of active bleeding was evident. In abdominal computed tomographic evaluation, an isodense and smooth contoured mass lesion of 52 × 25 × 32 mm that contained focal calcifications and was located on the greater gastric curvature in the left upper abdominal quadrant was detected (). Since the biopsy report indicated that the material was insufficient for a definitive diagnosis to be made, a deeper biopsy sampling was recommended. As such, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) was performed in an attempt to identify whether or not the mass was malignant. PET showed a smooth contoured mass of 5 × 5 cm, projecting from the gastric corpus into the lumen and containing scattered calcifications, which displayed no evidence of malignant transformation. A 6 × 4 × 5 cm mass was detected at the the greater gastric curvature on the anterior gastric surface during intraoperative"}

Five years ago, a previously documented squamous cell skin cancer lesion located in the left mandibular region was excised with clear margins. The lesion recurred 12 months before presentation to the medical oncology clinic; however, due to poor socioeconomic status she was unable to admit to the hospital. Her clinical condition recently deteriorated because the cancerous lesion became too painful and she was not capable of oral food intake any longer. Radiation oncology department decided that it would be difficult for the patient to tolerate radiotherapy because the lesion was deeply ulcerated and it was occupying a large region of the left side of the face. A tissue biopsy was taken to confirm tumor recurrence (). A computer tomography of the head and neck region demonstrated extensive soft tissue invasion of the tumor. She was referred to medical oncology department for chemotherapy. Standard cisplatin-based chemotherapy was not found appropriate because of the patient’s poor clinical status and therefore a decision was made to start her treatment with single agent cetuximab.\nThe patient was treated with cetuximab administered at a dose of 400 mg/m2 every 15 days, from September 29, 2013 to April 10, 2014. After the second cycle of the treatment, performance status improved and regression of the ulcerous lesion was visually observed. While the treatment continued, grade 2 acneiform rash on her face, neck, and mediastinum developed, which was successfully treated with vitamin K1 cream without needing dose reduction. She developed grade 3 anemia at the fifth month of treatment, which was treated with red blood cell transfusions as needed and the treatment was stopped at the end of 6 months because she denied any further therapy. The tumor lesion had completely regressed at the time the treatment was terminated (). At her last follow-up visit, which was 12 months after the end of cetuximab therapy, she was still in complete clinical remission."}

The first generalized seizure occurred at the age of 26 and was accompanied by attention and memory deficits for one week. Three further generalized seizures occurred in 9 years and interictal EEGs showed widespread slow wave activity. She reported several unsuccessful therapeutic attempts with carbamazepine (1000 mg/day) and fenobarbital (150 mg/day). Personality disorder with several cyclic episodes of depression and maniacal excitation were reported by the patient and in the past ten years she had been treated with paroxetine by outpatient psychiatric services. In the last six years she did not experience further seizures and she spontaneously decided to withdraw carbamazepine. In the last year further episodes of depression and anxiety had recurred, and were accompanied by two suicide attempts by poisoning. After the last suicidal attempt, an EEG was recorded in the intensive care unit and the observation of widespread slow wave activity prompted her referral to our clinic. Her cognitive performances were normal (Mini-Mental State Examination score: 30/30). During psychological assessment, beyond a logorrheic and anxious attitude, a history of peculiar events could be evicted even though the patient manifested initial severe resistance to express the reason of her distress.

Further radiological evaluation had been offered but the patient had refused any further evaluation or surgical intervention. Nearly two years after the initial diagnosis, the patient was readmitted to thoracic surgery department for further evaluation. On chest roentgenogram, a well-circumscribed mass in the middle zone of the left lung field was observed (). Chest tomography showed a well-circumscribed huge cystic mass measuring nearly 11 × 8 cm neighboring the aortic arch and left pulmonary artery, and a small cystic mass approximately measuring 5.0 cm on the sixth costosternal junction. A small nodular solid area was observed at the inferior margin of the huge cystic mass. These two masses were both well defined and homogeneous (Figures and ). During preparation for surgery, angina pectoris developed, and a cardiologic evaluation was performed. The patient underwent coronary angiography, and an atherosclerotic lesion causing significant stenosis was found in proximal and mid portions of left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery. After the coronary angiography, a decision was made to undertake surgery in order to remove the tumors and to perform coronary artery bypass grafting.\nIn preoperative evaluation, we considered it possible that the mass dwelling on the aortic arch may make it impossible for proximal anastomoses of coronary bypass. In order to avoid this complication, we decided to first remove the mass, then perform coronary artery bypass grafting using sternotomy, in a one-stage combined operation. The chest was opened by sternotomy, and a huge encapsulated mass was observed dwelling the aortic arch and the left pulmonary artery with a proximal extension to the ascending aorta (). After preserving the nervus vagus, the huge mass was removed by blunt and sharp dissection. The smaller tumor that originated from the intercostal nerve was also removed from the sixth costos"}

Her past history revealed the onset of myopia at the age of 12 years which gradually increased and stabilized by 18 years of age. At the age of 20 years she underwent radial keratotomy in both eyes for myopic correction. She developed secondary angle closure glaucoma in left eye following radial keratotomy (probably there was microperforation at the time of radial keratotomy, leading to shallow anterior chamber with formation of peripheral anterior synechiae leading to raised IOP) for which she underwent glaucoma filtering surgery without Mitomycin C elsewhere 8 months later. Records revealed IOP of less than 21 mmHg till few months postoperatively. A year later, she presented to us with a painful eye which on examination revealed flat anterior chamber in the periphery and very shallow centrally (Fig. ). The intraocular pressure as measured by applanation tonometer was 40 mmHg and her vision was light perception with inaccurate projection of rays.

A physical examination revealed a submucosal tumor with an intact and smooth surface in the right nasal vestibule. The result of biopsy was suspected malignancy. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a round lesion 1 cm in length in the right nasal vestibule close to the pyriform fossa edge of the right maxillary bone (). He had severe pulmonary dysfunction due to recurrent end stage lung cancer and diabetes. The expected remainder of his life would be half a year. Therefore, his very poor condition precluded general anesthesia. To relieve the nasal pain, shorten the stay in the hospital and improve the quality of life (QOL), we performed minimally invasive surgery under local anesthesia. In the operation, nasal vestibular tumors arising from the bone surface of the pyriform fossa could be resected using a right alar incision approach combined with a right gingival incision approach. After removing the tumors, a right alar flap was used to cover wounds with exposed bone (). Histopathology of the specimen indicated poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (). These cancer cells could be found in the submucosal areas in the nasal vestibule, but not on the surface or in the epithelial layers. The edges of the resected tumor did not show cancer cells. Postoperatively, the right nasal pain soon disappeared. The patient was discharge from our hospital 4 days after the operation. Two months later, findings in CT scan revealed widespread destruction of the maxillary bones. We consulted pathologists and radiologists. As a result, it was thought that maxillary bone metastasis from lung carcinoma had caused submucosal swelling of the nasal vestibule. The evidence was as follows. In the histopathological examination, cancerous areas were located in the submucosa but not in the upper layer, and the operative findings confirmed that cancer tissues had generated from the surface of maxillary bone. Moreover, the patient had undergone lung cancer surgery four years before. The histopathological characteristics"}

The patient had also bilateral diffuse lung metastasis on lung computed tomography. The patient had received 12 courses of chemotherapy. Resection of pelvic mass was not indicated because of diffuse lung metastasis. Right lower extremity had severe swelling. Above knee and thigh of the affected limb had larger diameter of 6.5 and 9.5 cm than the contralateral limb respectively. The patient suffered from right lower extremity pain and had a venous ulcer at right medial malleolus.\nWe did venography to reveal the underlying cause of venous stasis in right lower extremity. We did the imaging on prone position. A 5F sheath was introduced through the right popliteal vein. The external iliac vein had severe stenosis and invasion of pelvic mass into the vein was evident. This procedure was done under close monitoring of vital signs and local anesthesia. We transformed the patient to supine position to cannulate right superficial femoral vein (SFV). An 8F sheath was introduced into SFV by ultrasound guidance and Seldinger technique 10cm below the inguinal ligament. The reason for changing the position of the patient was that the procedure of stenting is painful. We wanted to do the procedure under deep sedation and it was not possible to do this in prone position because of general condition of the patient. A repeat venogram was obtained at supine position and similar results were found ().

The pathology report was in compliance with the first report of the urethral adenocarcinoma. Postoperatively, the patient received 54 Gy/30 fraction radiotherapy. At the end of the same year the patient suffered a mass in her right thigh that caused a suspicion of another metastasis. Tru-cut biopsy was performed and pathology specimens revealed malignant mesenchymal tumor. 28 Gy/8 fraction preoperative radiotherapy was applied due to close neighbourhood of the tumor to the femoral artery and the tumor being larger than 5 centimeters in diameter. Following preoperative radiotherapy, wide resection of the tumor was performed. The pathology reports showed a high grade pleomorphic sarcoma. The oncology consultation did not recommend postoperative chemotherapy, but 20 Gy/10 fraction adjuvant radiotherapy was applied.\nFor the next three years the patient was regularly followed and no evidence of local or systemic relapse was present.

The blood exams were within normal values, while the arterial blood analysis demonstrated increased lactic acid levels and compromised pO2 values. Chest X-ray revealed that the right lung was totally suppressed by the intestine and suggested that due to intestinal transposition to the thoracic cavity, a functional right pneumonectomy had occurred (). CT scan of the thorax and abdomen detected a right diaphragm defect and herniation of the small intestine, which was also ischaemic due to venous circulation occlusion (). Urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed, and it revealed a diaphragm defect of 10 × 2 cm extending from the anterior side of the right diaphragm to the posterolateral side. Almost all the small intestine and part of the transverse colon were extending to the right thoracic cavity through the defect and were ischaemic and immobilized due to venous stasis. The herniated part of the small intestine and transverse colon were separated from the lung and retracted into the abdominal cavity, whereas the diaphragmatic defect was closed by direct suturing with Prolene 2-0"}
{"note": "A 28-year-old male patient reported to the Department of Periodontology and Oral Implantology with a chief complaint of a fractured crown in relation to root canal treated maxillary left central incisor. The patient had undergone root canal treatment of the tooth 3 years back and had received fixed bridge prosthesis in relation to the bilateral maxillary central incisor regions. The patient reported that the prosthesis got avulsed and the crown portion of the maxillary left central incisor was fractured following the biting into a hard food substance. The patient also reported the previous dental treatment to be unsatisfactory in terms of the final esthetic and functional outcomes of the prosthesis. Patient expressed preference for a single crown prosthesis and considered his previous bridge prosthesis, a failure in simulating the natural tooth appearance. There were no other relevant dental and medical histories. The patient was a teetotaler and his family history was non-contributory, whereby the confounding environmental and genetic risk factors were deemed absent. Intraoral examination revealed a fractured root canal treated maxillary left central incisor. The right maxillary central incisor had undergone tooth preparation as a part of the previous bridge prosthesis. Oral hygiene maintenance was satisfactory and on examination, the gingival and periodontal status of the patient also appeared to be apparently healthy.\nThe patient was explained in detail about the various treatment modalities available, the advantages and disadvantages of each type of therapy as well as the cost factor related to each therapeutic mode. Taking into consideration the esthetic and functional demands in the anterior esthetic region and the patient's request for an implant-based fixed prosthetic rehabilitation, the final treatment plan was formulated. An atraumatic extraction of the fractured, root canal treated maxillary left central incisor and an immediate implant placement was decided upon as the final treatment plan for the patient. A written informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to commencement of the surgical procedure.\nThe surgical site was anesthetized by local administration of 2% lignocaine hydrochloride (LOX, Neon Laboratories Ltd., Mumbai, India) with 1"}

Prior to admission, his symptoms had been well controlled with azathioprine for maintenance therapy. A chest x-ray demonstrated right upper and left lower lobe pulmonary opacities, and a subsequent CT scan revealed multiple pulmonary nodules with associated hilar lymphadenopathy. Due to concern regarding a possible infectious etiology that would preclude administration of additional medical therapy, a thoracoscopic biopsy was performed. There were no perioperative complications. The chest tube, which was placed routinely for the treatment of potential pulmonary air leak, was removed on post-operative day two after no air leak was identified. The pathology demonstrated necrotic neutrophilic nodules without granulomas, which were consistent with pulmonary manifestations of his UC. Operative cultures and additional infectious workup were negative. He was then treated with a three-month course of corticosteroids and started on mesalamine for maintenance therapy with subsequent improvement in his symptoms and a decrease in size of the nodules on CT scan 10 days after initiation of therapy. He presented again two years later with similar symptomatology in the setting of an IBD flare, and the nodules were noted to be larger, but in the same locations. Between these presentations, his UC maintenance therapy was changed to azathioprine. He was again treated with a three-month course of corticosteroids while continuing azathioprine with resolution of his symptoms and a decrease in size of the nodules on CT scan one month later. One year later, he had developed left-sided pleuritic chest pain and worsening of his UC symptoms. The decision was made to initiate infliximab for the management of his UC, and a CT scan was repeated to evaluate the nodules prior to change in therapy. The nodules were noted, again, to be"}

He had a diffuse swelling around the elbow, with no external wounds. On examination there was diffuse swelling with a hard bony lump on medial aspect of the elbow. The radial head was not in place clinically. He had weakness of the flexors of the fifth and fourth digits of the hand with a hypoaesthesia in the distribution of the ulnar nerve.\nA radiograph of the elbow showed a fracture of the radial neck with dislocation of the radial head onto the medial side. However radial head was intact [].\nThe patient was taken up for open reduction on an emergency basis. The radial head was palpable in the subcutaneous plane and it was approached through a short curvilinear incision on the medial side centered over the displaced radial head, and the head could be delivered out. A separate lateral Kocher incision was used to approach the proximal radius; the radial head was repositioned anatomically and fixed with a mini fragment T plate, and the annular ligament was repaired. The stability was checked in the elbow. The ulnar nerve was not explored A posterior above elbow slab was used to protect the elbow for 3 weeks followed by active elbow mobilization.\nPostoperatively, an ulnar nerve injury was confirmed on detailed examination once pain had come down and the child was more cooperative. The patient was started on indomethacin 25 mg empirically twice a day for 3 weeks. The patient was lost to followup from this time onward for the next few months. He reported back to the outpatient department at 6 months for review. He had a range of motion at the elbow from 30° to 130° with no supination and good pronation. He was satisfied with function.

The patient reported that the pain had come on gradually and it had caused her to go from walking independently to requiring the use of a cane and to eventually a walker. The patient underwent an MRI of the lumbar spine 1 month prior to delivery because of concerns that her pain and weakness were radicular in nature. A limited MRI of the lumbar spine, with only sagittal and axial reconstruction and without extension to the pelvis or hips, showed a mild disk bulge at L3-4 and L4-5. She was prescribed a Medrol Dosepak for a herniated disk and right lower extremity radiculopathy.\nThe patient continued to experience pain and difficulty ambulating. She presented to the obstetric service at 38 weeks with elevated blood pressure and headaches, and was admitted to labor and delivery for induction of labor. After 16 hours of labor, the decision was made to perform a cesarean section because of concerns for worsening of the right lower extremity radiculopathy and suspected fetal macrosomia, complicated by intrapartum hemorrhage. After her cesarean and delivery, the patient experienced increased severe pain in her right hip and was unable to ambulate. The obstetrics and gynecology team first consulted the neurology service, and an MRI of the pelvis was recommended to evaluate for possible compressive femoral nerve neuropathy. The neurology team also started her on a low dose of prednisone. On the pelvic MRI, she was found to have a displaced right femoral neck fracture with signs of femoral head bone marrow edema and a focal area of bone edema in the left femoral head with mild flattening of the femoral head (Figure ). The radiologist described the areas of edema in both hips as possible ON. At this point, the orthopaedic service was consulted and a pelvic radiograph was obtained (Figure ).\nThe patient had no known history of trauma or falls during her pregnancy."}
{"note": "A 29-year-old Saudi woman presented to our Emergency Room with a five-day history of epigastric and lower abdominal pain associated with lower abdominal and pelvic fullness that she attributed to fibroids. The pain was intermittent, colicky in nature and associated with nausea and vomiting. She denied any history of fever and there had been no change in her bowel habits or urinary symptoms. For several months she had been followed up regularly at the gynecology clinic due to the lower abdominal heaviness and distension. Her gynecological history revealed a nulliparous woman with no vaginal bleeding. Her medical history was significant for epilepsy since childhood, which was well controlled by medication, and a laparoscopic appendectomy one year ago. On examination, she was alert and conscious. Her vital signs were stable. Her abdomen was distended with a palpable pelvic-abdominal mass that was hard, non-tender and slightly mobile. Her liver and spleen were within the normal range and she had normal bowel sounds. No lymph nodes were enlarged and digital rectal examination revealed no abnormalities.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen and pelvis showed a pelvic/abdominal mass adjacent to the distal small bowel loops separate from the uterus and ovaries, heterogeneously enhancing, measuring roughly 65 × 99 mm with multiple areas of necrosis (Figure ). A CT scan of her chest showed indeterminate multiple bilateral subpleural 2 mm to 4 mm lung nodules, too small to biopsy.\nThe case was discussed by the multidisciplinary tumor board and the advice was to confirm the diagnosis to eliminate the possibility of an ovarian origin of the tumor because of its very close proximity.\nSurgical exploration was indicated due to the finding of a large mass that was composed of a cystic and also a large solid component that needed to be investigated to eliminate the possibility of lymphoma or tuberculosis, which is quite common in our population. However, there was some radiological confusion about the origin of this mass and to some colleagues it was necessary to confirm it with a histological biopsy"}

His chief complaint was forearm tenderness extending down to the hand. The patient described an immediate onset of pain, which radiated down the arm into the hand. Clinical examination revealed a fresh injection mark at the ulnar side of the distal right forearm without signs of local inflammation. The patient had a neurovascular intact hand with 5/5 motor strength for wrist and finger extension and flexion. Digital two point discrimination, as well as capillary refill of acral digits was found to be within normal limits and a strong radial pulse was palpated, no ulnar pulse was documented. No further apparative diagnostic were performed at initial presentation. The patient was discharged with analgesic medication and told to return if symptoms aggravated. 18 hours after the injection the patient was urgently referred back to the ED by his general practitioner and presented with an ischemic hand. The right hand was found to be cold and held in a flexed position. There was absent ulnar artery pulse and only a faint radial artery pulse palpable, Allen's test was pathological. The hand showed blue discoloration and there was tenderness over the thenar eminence and hypoesthesia over the digits 1 through 5 as evidenced by a two point discrimination of greater than 8 mm (See Fig ). Emergent angiography revealed no flow in the distal ulnar artery and absent deep and superficial palmar arch perfusion (Fig. ). The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and urokinase lysis via an indwelling intraarterial catheter was started at 20 hours after injection with 240.000 IU/h over 2 hours followed by half the dose for 2 hours.\nThe patient was closely monitored for possible compartment syndrome of the forearm and hand with potential need for decompressive surgical intervention.

Physical examination revealed hollowness below the acromion process on either side with flattening of the normal contour of the shoulders with the arm held in external rotation and abduction on the left side and in slight internal rotation on the right side. No peripheral neurological deficit was noted. No specific history of the mode of injury could be elicited as there was no witness of the episode and the patient could not clearly recall the event.\nRadiographs revealed anterior shoulder dislocation with a displaced greater tuberosity fracture on the left side () and posterior dislocation with lesser tuberosity fracture on the right side (). Both the dislocations were promptly reduced by closed manipulation in the emergency department and post-reduction radiographs showed persistent but decreased displacement of both the tuberosities (more on the side with the greater tuberosity fracture) (, ). A CT scan of both shoulder joints was done for better demonstration of the fracture pattern (, ).\nAfter preoperative workup, anesthetic evaluation, physician consultation and informed consent, patient was taken up for surgery. Lesser tuberosity fracture on the right side was fixed using two partially threaded cannulated screws using deltopectoral approach to the shoulder (). The greater tuberosity fracture on the left side was similarly fixed using two partially threaded cannulated screws via direct lateral approach (). Post-operatively both the shoulders were immobilized in a shoulder immobilizer for three weeks. Physical therapy was started as tolerated by the patient at four weeks. She was able to resume her daily activities by two months. At one year follow-up, the patient was free of pain in both shoulder joints and radiographs revealed consolidation at the fracture site with no re-dislocations occurring during the follow up period. After aggressive physiotherapy, the range of motion was near normal on the left side but slight limitation of abduction (range 0-120 degrees) was"}

He had undergone previous resections of his lower lip carcinoma and a left tonsillectomy a year before. He had received postoperative radiation and chemotherapy and presented with a recurrence of his cancer as well as osteoradionecrosis of the mandible requiring composite resection of his tumor and bilateral neck dissection.\nThe patient’s mandibular and intraoral mucosal defect was reconstructed with a free fibula flap from the right leg with a skin paddle measuring 17 × 8 cm along with a 2.4-mm reconstruction plate. A closing wedge osteotomy was performed at the area of the mandibular symphysis on the fibula to allow for the bend of the fibula into the contours of the mandible. An ALT flap from the right leg with a skin paddle measuring 14 × 22 cm was used to reconstruct the external soft tissue. The left lingual artery and the internal jugular vein served as recipient vessels for the free fibula flap. The ALT flap was anastomosed to the ipsilateral facial artery and the internal jugular vein. As in the previous case, a tensor fascia lata sling anchored bilaterally on the anterior aspect of the zygoma was used to suspend the lower lip reconstruction and restore oral competence ().\nOn postoperative day 3 the patient presented with an acute arterial thrombosis of the ALT artery. The arterial anastomosis was revised and the left ascending pharyngeal artery was employed as a recipient vessel for reanastomosis to the ALT artery. Despite revision of the anastomosis, the flap progressed on to total necrosis likely due to the no reflow phenomenon. The patient received a second ALT flap from the left thigh with a 14 × 26 cm skin paddle. An end-to-side anastomosis between the ALT artery and the right common carotid artery was performed. The right internal jugular vein served as recipient vessel for the venous anastomosis. The right neck was chosen since"}

She presented to our clinic with complaints of worsening pain in the lower extremities with activity and sometimes pain at rest. The patient had a medical history of hypertension and admitted to non-compliance with medication. She has been smoking cigarettes for 11 years and usually consumes 1 pack per day. In addition, she reported a strong family history of coronary artery disease. The patient was taken to the office-based lab located within the clinic and was prepared sterilely for a catheter arteriogram.\nCatheter arteriogram results showed significant occlusion of the left iliac artery ( and ), the right iliac artery (), as well as the distal abdominal aorta (). There were numerous collateral vessels noted, indicating the presence of long-standing proximal stenosis (). The decision was made to use angioplasty to help widen the areas of stenosis. An 8 mm × 40 mm Passeo balloon was advanced from the right femoral artery into the left iliac artery () and insufflated to 6 mmHg (). The balloon was allowed to remain expanded for 1 min and then was deflated. Next, the distal aorta was repaired in a similar fashion. The balloon was advanced into the distal aorta from the right femoral access and insufflated to 12 mmHg (). The balloon was allowed to remain expanded for 90 s.\nLastly, the right iliac artery () was treated using the same method (). After completion of the angioplasty procedure, catheter arteriogram was repeated to visualize the effectiveness of the procedure in relieving the extensive stenosis. The imaging revealed almost complete restoration of the diameter of both left and right iliac arteries ( and ). The distal aorta also showed improved diameter after the procedure (). Angiogram of both lower extremities was also performed.

She was a mother of two sons with a history of contraceptive injection use for 5 years and suffered from type II diabetes for 4 years with routine insulin treatment. She presented with a left breast mass that had appeared several months ago. In the past 3 months, the mass grew quickly and developed a 15 × 15 cm inflammatory wound. A core needle biopsy was performed in the district hospital on June 2018 on this unresectable lesion. Pathology tests revealed ductal invasive breast cancer. An immunohistochemistry test revealed a positive estrogen receptor at 90%, a negative progesterone receptor, a negative Her2 and 75% of KI 67 expression and a poor histology grade. Her referral process to our clinic was slow because of the convoluted administration. During this process, she developed a cough. When presented in our clinic for chemotherapy she had shortness of breath. The clinical and imaging examination revealed a moderate pericardial effusion, a pleural effusion, pneumonic and subpleural type pulmonal metastases (Figure ) and bone metastasis in the form of a wedged fracture in the 12th thoracic vertebra. The pericardial effusion progressed significantly and she very quickly developed a life-threatening cardiac tamponade (Figure ). She was then referred to the cardiology ward. Echocardiography revealed a massive pericardial effusion with flying heart and collapsed right atrium and right ventricle. To release the pericardial fluid, a pericardial window procedure was immediately applied. A chest tube was placed within the pericardial cavity to drain the pericardial fluid from the pericardial space. Further, cytology examination confirmed that both the pericardial effusion and the pleural effusion contained metastatic breast cancer cells. One week after the pericardial window procedure she recovered from the severe dyspnea and all the devices were then removed. A total deep vein thrombosis in her right popliteal vein was also identified and treated with unfractionated heparin followed by 20 mg daily oral rivaroxaban.\nWe then considered a palliative chemotherapy treatment despite her low performance ("}

Radiographs were obtained which demonstrated a four-part proximal humerus fracture and dislocation of the left glenohumeral joint (). The patient was admitted, and on hospital day 3, she underwent open reduction internal fixation of her proximal humerus fracture dislocation (). A deltopectoral approach was utilized for this procedure. Venous bleeding was controlled with electrocautery. The cephalic vein was properly identified during the dissection and was not injured. There were no other intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful hospital course and was discharged on postoperative day two on 325 mg acetylsalicylic acid once daily for DVT prophylaxis. On postoperative day five the patient returned to our outpatient clinic complaining of increased swelling and discomfort of the left upper extremity. Physical exam showed increased swelling with pitting edema and an intact neurovascular exam. An upper extremity duplex ultrasound was obtained which demonstrated occlusive thrombosis in the cephalic and deep brachial veins of the left forearm. The patient was referred to our Vascular Medicine service and anticoagulation therapy was initiated with enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily for two days followed by rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 21 days. Follow-up examination demonstrated improvement in symptoms and reduction in swelling. The patient was then transitioned to long-term prophylaxis using rivaroxaban 20 mg daily for eight weeks.

She was completely asymptomatic and the physical exam was strictly normal. Endocrinological evaluation was done with normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and no hyper secretion of catecholamines. The patient was considered to have a non-secreting right adrenal mass for which an adrenal scan was done and showed a well encapsulated 10 × 9 × 7 cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass with areas of necrosis and calcifications without local invasion (). The decision of right laparoscopic trans peritoneal adrenalectomy was taken with the patient. The surgery was done under general anesthesia after central and arterial lines insertion, the patient was on left decubitus position. 5 trocars were inserted as follows: The first 12-mm port was inserted at the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle just above the level of the umbilicus to accommodate the camera. Two subcostal 11 mm ports were also placed; one in the midclavicular line and the other in the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle. The forth 5-mm subcostal trocar was inserted in the anterior axillary line to retract the liver and the fifth 5 mm one was inserted in the epigastrium and used specially for aspiration and irrigation. After liver retraction, the peritoneum along the lateral aspect of the IVC was incised to expose the IVC just below its intrahepatic course. The duodenum which was diverted by the mass was mobilized.

On her obstetric history, she had a vaginal delivery following an uneventful pregnancy course 8 years ago. Her second pregnancy was terminated via hysterotomy at 18th weeks due to multiple fetal abnormalities including hydrocephalus. She was diagnosed to have total anterior placenta previa on her third pregnancy. This last pregnancy was otherwise uneventful and the patient gave birth to a term, healthy infant via planned repeat cesarean section in a private hospital. During the operation, partially adherent placenta had been detected and the adherent part of the placenta had been left in situ. Postoperative treatment had not been given. 20 days after the operation, she had been hospitalized due to massive vaginal bleeding and had been transfused four units of packed red blood cells since her blood count revealed severe anemia with a hemoglobin level of 5.6 gr/dL. She had been discharged from hospital three days later. However, one week later, she had presented to another center due to vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. She had been referred to our hospital with a presumptive diagnosis of placental retention because ultrasonography showed soft tissue density with irregular contour in the endometrial cavity (). On her admission, she had findings consistent with acute abdomen and moderate abdominal distention was detected. Her blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg and heart rate was 110/minute. Hemoglobin was 8.5 gr/dL on complete blood count. Ultrasonography revealed free fluid filling the pelvis and lower abdomen. Her serum human chorionic gonadotropin was negative.

Seven days later, the patient underwent a right radical nephrectomy, a resection of the extended tumor in the abdominal IVC and a pulmonary embolectomy in one session. The right radical nephrectomy was performed via laparotomy first. At the same time, the lower abdominal IVC was exposed to insert venous cannula to run the heart-lung machine. In succeeding, through a median sternotomy, ascending aortic arterial cannulation and triple venous cannulation of superior vena cava, thoracic IVC, and infra-renal IVC were made. On beating heart under cardiopulmonary bypass, resection of the extended tumor in the abdominal IVC was performed (). And then, emboli in the left pulmonary artery and its branches were pulled out with forceps via left pulmonary arteriotomy following vent catheter insertion into right ventricle through proximal main pulmonary artery with distal main pulmonary artery snaring (). The emboli on the other side were removed with same manner via right pulmonary arteriotomy (). After primary repair of both pulmonary arteries, cardiopulmonary bypass was weaned off. Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 208 minutes. The renal mass was proved to be renal cell carcinoma. Thrombi in abdominal IVC and pulmonary arteries were confirmed as tumor emboli of renal cell carcinoma. Seventeen days after the surgery, the patient was discharged without any complications.

{"note": "A 70-year-old male patient was referred to the emergency department with a sudden- onset back pain complaint that lasted for approximately 3 days. His medical history included hypertension. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) in the arterial phase revealed the aneurysm’s origin, the aortic arch and branches in each of the three planes, and the structure of the aneurysm, its diameter, segment length, and relationship of the aneurysm with the supraaortic structures. CT from another medical center detected an impending aneurysm rupture in the descending aorta with a diameter of 64 mm (). Both carotid arteries originated from a common trunk from the aortic arch, and there was no aneurysmatic dilatation in the aortic arch. Ascending aorta aneurysm, reaching 60 mm in diameter at the largest, was detected. Aortic regurgitation was not detected in transthoracic echocardiography. Aortic arch was not aneurysmatic. The patient was evaluated in cardiovascular surgery and invasive radiology joint council. Due to the character of the back pain, only an emergent surgical intervention to impending aneurysm rupture at descending aorta was decided. Endovascular repair to the descending aortic aneurysm was planned. The occlusion of the left SA orifice was planned after it was considered that there was not enough neck to position the proximal stent graft. The right SA was aberrant, and the orifice of the right aberrant SA was within the aneurysm sac that was going to be occluded. It was decided to bypass both SAs. Since the patient had ascending aortic aneurysm, and this aneurysm had an elective surgery indication, an extra-anatomic bypass was decided instead of median sternotomy. Because of the widespread aneurysm in the patient and the associated risk of atherosclerosis and the condition of the Willis polygon are unknown, it was decided to use ECA for the donor artery if calibration was appropriate to avoid brain ischemia. To avoid arm ischemia, it was decided to perform bypass operations first.\nOne of the operating rooms at the cardiac surgery clinic in our hospital is specifically designed for diagnostic and interventional procedures using radiation.

The patient had first noticed right lateral abdominal pain 2 months prior to the visit, and the pain was gradually worsening. The abdominal pain was localized in an area ranging from the right upper to the right lateral abdomen. The patient had undergone cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis as a 32-year-old in Latin America and had moved to Japan for work approximately 3 years prior to his initial visit to our hospital. He had returned to Latin America once about 6 to 7 months before presenting at our clinic. When he went back to Japan, his weight had increased from 130 kg to 145 kg. He did not experience abdominal pain immediately after his return to Japan, but, as noted above, he started to gradually feel pain in the right lateral region about 2 months prior to presentation.\nHe first visited another hospital emergency department 1 month after onset of the pain. Initially, gastrointestinal tract spasm was suspected, and he was treated with tiquizium bromide. Though the medication partially relieved his abdominal pain, most of the pain persisted. The result of a workup by a urologist was negative, even though nephrolithiasis was suspected. His abdominal pain was exacerbated upon changing posture, and thus it was suspected to be of somatic rather than visceral origin. Abdominal pain persisted despite treatment with loxoprofen sodium hydrate, and any cause of abdominal pain was not detected on further evaluations, including hematologic laboratory analysis, urine analysis, gastroscopy, or abdominal computed tomography (CT). Finally, he was referred to our hospital for further examination.\nThe results of screening for depression were negative, and the patient did not have symptoms such as loss of interest, depressed feelings, or any specific changes of surrounding conditions, such as family or work environment changes. He had no history of sexually transmitted infection, and his vital signs were within normal limits. His physical examination result was positive for Carnett�"}

T5 posterior fusion and decompression was performed to stabilize her, but the injury was complete with no return of function after 2 years. A baclofen pump was inserted into the L3 level for spasticity after few months of the injury. The severity of the injury was classified as grade A using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grading, which is defined as complete loss of motor and sensory functions below the level of the injury ().\nThe stimulator that was used in this study is approved by FDA for chronic pain treatment (). After obtaining informed consent from the patient, a total of 8 leads with 8 electrodes each were implanted at L2, L3, L4, and S1 bilaterally. Four leads for a total of 16 electrodes on each nerve root with two leads each were implanted at L5 bilaterally. The procedure was performed under general anesthetic with a small laminotomy at T12 to facilitate retrograde advancement and insertion of percutaneous leads to each level (). The procedure was done and guided under fluoroscopy and the total surgical time was ~120 min. A total of 2 batteries, with four ports each, were utilized connecting in the following configuration: 8 electrodes to D port for S1, 16 electrodes with a splitter to C port, 8 electrodes from L4 and 8 electrodes to L3 with a splitter to B port, and 8 electrodes to A port from L2. This allowed activating every other contact on each lead that is plugged in the splitter.

His medical history showed that he had allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis that had been treated until 3 months previously by an otolaryngologist.\nThe patient initially visited our outpatient clinic with complaints of high fever, sore throat, and comorbid right cheek pain and mild swelling 6 weeks previously. A checkup at a dental clinic performed on the day before this initial visit revealed no abnormal findings. He showed clinical symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis. A rapid antigen test for group A streptococcal infection showed positive results. The patient was diagnosed with streptococcal infection. Facial cellulitis was also suspected and treatment with amoxicillin helped improve symptoms. However, facial pain recurred within 4 weeks of the initial visit. The patient had mild tenderness and swelling of the right cheek. Head computed tomography revealed mild mucous membrane swelling and effusion in both sinuses ( left). Because recurrence of cellulitis with sinusitis was suspected, cefditoren pivoxil treatment was initiated. However, because the pain persisted, he visited our department.\nPhysical examination revealed no abnormal findings except right cheek tenderness in the area that corresponded with the region supplied by the second branch of the trigeminal nerve (the maximally nerve). Although marked tenderness was evident, no point with hyperalgesia, where a light touch elicited severe pain, was observed. No facial paralysis or oral disorders were observed. Blood examination revealed no abnormal findings. Recurrence of sinusitis was suspected. Based on the physical examination and laboratory tests, the patient was clinically diagnosed with TN. Subsequently, oral clarithromycin administration was initiated for sinusitis that might have caused or exacerbated TN. However, administration of clarithromycin for 1 week was not effective for his facial pain.

Peritoneal drainage was performed because gastric perforation was found soon after resuscitation. Thereafter, a diagnosis of TEF was made, and gastrostomy was created in the previous hospital. He was transferred to our institution at 28 days of age. He was diagnosed as having an EA with a distal TEF (Gross C), and the primary repair of the EA with fistula division was performed at our hospital when he was 5 months of age. The postoperative course was uneventful, and gastrostomy was closed at 10 months of age. He discharged at 2 year of age. After his discharge, severe epilepsy and encephalopathy due to encephalitis occurred, and he became disabled with severe mental retardation at the age of 2. He could not feed orally. At the age of 3, he underwent Nissen fundoplication and re-gastrostomy because of gastroesophageal reflux and hiatus hernia. At the time of the operation, subglottic stenosis was suspected because he could only be intubated with a tracheal tube of 2.5 mm in diameter.\nSix months after fundoplication, a recurrence of hiatus hernia was found, which involved the herniation of the stomach and small and large intestine into the thoracic cavity. A reoperation to repair the herniation was not performed because the patient had been in stable condition. However, he had been suffering from recurrent respiratory tract infections since he was 7 years of age. In addition, severe bronchial asthma worsened his respiratory symptoms.

There was no complaint of cold sensitivity to the mass. The pain occasionally radiated down the ulnar aspect of her wrist. She had no known history of previous trauma to this area; however, she did have a history of squamous cell carcinoma to the dorsal-radial aspect of that hand. This had been treated previously for which she subsequently developed a reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), resulting in a delayed recovery in the range of motion. A previous stellate ganglion block did not provide relief for her RSD, and her range of motion had been slowly progressing with home exercises.\nOn physical exam, a small round nodule approximately 5 mm x 5 mm was palpable dorsal to the extensor carpi ulnaris and 1 cm proximal to the ulnar styloid. There was significant point tenderness that did not radiate or display a Tinel’s sign. Her imaging included plain films of the affected extremity that showed no abnormality outside of diffuse osteopenia.\nThe location and exam were consistent with a neuroma that had evolved from a cutaneous nerve or possibly from the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve. The patient was taken to the operative theatre and deep dissection revealed a maroon-colored mass approximately 5 mm x 5 mm, connected to a cutaneous nerve branch.

{"note": "This case presents a 38-year-old Asian G2P1001 female who delivered by cesarean section (CS) at 32 weeks gestation for pre-eclampsia with severe features with uncontrollable blood pressures. Her pregnancy was further complicated by a known right ovarian mass, history of endometriosis which was managed conservatively, as well as infertility. Both first and second pregnancies were conceived via in vitro fertilization by frozen embryo transfer. Her first pregnancy was otherwise uncomplicated, however resulted in primary CS for nonreassuring fetal heart tracing. No pelvic pathology was noted during that CS. The patient was first diagnosed with a right ovarian mass during her second pregnancy while on IVF treatment. The patient declined the option of removing the mass due to possibility of damaging the nearby ovarian tissue during removal of the mass and thus worsening her infertility. The IVF treatment was successful. The transvaginal ultrasonography performed during the early pregnancy suspected the right ovarian mass as endometrioma or desmoid tumor ().\nThe mass was kept under surveillance by performing periodic ultrasound imaging. Due to the change in mass characteristics and increase in size, the patient was referred to a Gynecologic Oncologist during second trimester. Considering the high risk pregnancy, recommendation was made to follow the mass with sequential ultrasound with the removal of the mass at the time of repeat CS as long as the mass did not change in size or configuration during the pregnancy and patient remained asymptomatic. Unfortunately, the patient developed pre-eclampsia with severe features at 32 weeks of gestation. Upon admission, she was given magnesium sulfate infusion for seizure prophylaxis and corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity. The Maternal-Fetal-Medicine specialists recommended delivery at thirty-four weeks of gestation unless there were new signs of maternal or fetal instability. However, three days after the admission, she underwent an emergency cesarean section due to recurrent severe blood pressure changes which were unresponsive to intravenous antihypertensive medications.\nDuring cesarean section, extensive adhesions were noted at the level of adipose tissue, rectus muscle, and anterior surface of the uterus, which were densely adhered to"}

The local temperature was raised with tenderness on deep palpation restricting terminal knee flexion. On anteroposterior and lateral Roentgenogram, there was an eccentric lytic and sclerotic lesion in the left distal end femur with a narrow zone of transition without evidence of joint involvement, with some areas of soft-tissue calcification and minimal periosteal reaction. Core biopsy done reported to have cellular tissues with multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells admixed with mononuclear cells, round to oval to spindle-shaped without significant cellular atypia and histological diagnosis of GCT was made.\nThe patient was lost to follow up, presented 3 months later with an enlarged mass measuring 15 cm x 12 cm with ulceration over the lateral aspect of the knee ().

{"note": "A 66-year-old female patient was admitted with the diagnosis of an approximately 10 cm painless and immobile mass between the clavicle and the chin on the right side of the neck. A vascular mass originating from the carotid body was detected in ultrasonography and a tomography was performed. In sagittal and axial image of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), a solid lesion in the right carotid area was detected that pushes the internal and external carotid artery and jugular vein; it was approximately 80 mm×90 mm×100 mm in size, with smooth contours and well-circumscribed, intense contrast enhancement (). Embolization was decided before curative surgery as the large diameter of the mass made it difficult for dissection due to compression on surrounding nerves, and dense collaterals that could cause bleeding. Digital subtraction angiography was depicted that the lesion was fed with multiple collaterals originating from the external and internal carotid arteries and the lesion was suitable for embolization (). In embolization, following the right external and internal carotid artery selective catheterization, all the feeding arteries emerging from these vessels were entered one by one and the vessels belonging to the tumor were tried to be closed with Onyx® glue-cast particles (an adhesive liquid embolic agent) under general anesthesia and subtracted fluoroscopic monitoring. Particles were introduced slowly by continuous fluoroscopy to prevent the backflow of particles. The procedure resulted in a significant decrease in blood flow and the tumor was observed to shrink in digital subtraction angiography (). No complications were noted to occur during and after the procedure. Neck contrast-enhanced CT performed after embolization showed that the intense contrast enhancement decreased, the carotid artery branches became prominent and their arching decreased in coronal and axial images (). The carotid body tumor in our case was type II, as per the classification made by Shamblin et al. Two days after embolization, the patient was taken to surgery for curative tumor excision.

Although the patient had been consulted for a diagnostic colonoscopy, due to his lack of consent, the procedure had been canceled, and he was then scheduled for a diagnostic barium enema. The enema had been done using a 28F plastic rectal tube, followed by rectal infusion of 96% barium-sulfate solution at a pressure of 100 centimeters of water.\nIn our first emergent visit, the patient complained of a vague pain in his lower abdomen, which had started immediately following the rectal tube's insertion. He believed that the pain had increased during the procedure. Except for a history of chronic heart failure and atrial fibrillation, we found no other previous medical or surgical condition in the patient.

Patient was subsequently diagnosed with primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis. The patient was evaluated by the oncology and radiation oncology services and underwent multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Her course of chemotherapy was complicated by thrombocytopenia and metastatic disease progression. The patient was determined to be a nonsurgical candidate. Gradually, her pain of the right upper extremity worsened, and the patient was started on opioid therapy. Despite titration of her oral medications to extended release morphine 90 mg two times a day, immediate release morphine 30 mg every 2 to 3 hours, methadone 5 mg daily, and gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, her pain control remained suboptimal.

During trauma screening including CT brain, he was found to have multiple brain contusions and an incidental finding of extensive optic glioma. After that, an MRI brain showed that the optic glioma was very extensive in the brain parenchyma, to the point it was extending from both optic nerves through the optic chiasm and to the whole optic pathways bilaterally (). Moreover, it was extending to intraventricular system and to the sella and suprasellar region. Patient was managed and treated in the paediatric intensive care unit with conservative treatment for the head injury. The patient ended up with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 8/15.\nDue to his poor neurological status, with this extensive optic glioma, it was decided by paediatric neuro-oncology tumour board that there is no further treatment that can be offered to him. During his follow-up, he was found to have a significant increase in his head circumference which reached up to 74 cm. The brain MRI was repeated and showed progression of the tumour size and the hydrocephalus; therefore, a VP shunt was inserted. After 4 months, the VP shunt was complicated by recurrent abdominal ascites due to scarring from previous abdominal exploratory surgery, and high protein in the CSF. This required us to do multiple revisions and tapping of the abdominal ascites by inserting a peg tail. At this point, he failed the management of multiple VP shunt revisions.\nCSF protein was found most of the time to be more than 20 g/L, and he was required to have frequent periodic ascitic tapping almost every 3 weeks.

She had negative thoughts about the headache destroying her daily life and became stressed from having headache. The patient did not exercise regularly although she thought she should. This made her feel unsatisfied with herself. She was taking her migraine medicine several times a week (), more often than she thought was healthy. Her perception of disability and feelings of loss of happiness were highly varying depending on how much headache she had (). She had a low self-efficacy for managing her headaches ().\nThere were several behaviors that were supposed to contribute to her headaches, which led to several intertwined FBAs. Contracting her muscles of shoulders, neck, and jaw was a behavioral response primarily in situations when she felt psychological stress. This physical reaction was hypothesized to be a conditioned response to situations that resembled earlier stressful situations and thereby occurred more frequently. She perceived the stress in situations when she was feeling not in control, often because of not only headache but also work-related tasks. Automatic negative thoughts were common in these situations. The consequence was tension and headache and even more stress of not being in control, which positively reinforced her automatic negative thoughts. Her feeling of anxiety for getting headaches"}

He felt a popping sensation with his left hip in deep flexion and the left knee in forced extension and a sharp pain in the posterolateral aspect of the left distal thigh. He could not bear weight on the affected leg, which prevented him from walking and he was immediately transferred to our hospital. He had no history of other trauma, chronic disease, or use of corticosteroids. A clinical examination revealed swelling and tenderness at the posterolateral aspect of the left distal thigh. The ridge formed by the left biceps femoris tendon was distinctly deficient to both visual inspection and palpation. Active extension or flexion of the left knee was prevented by severe pain. Ligamentous instability of the knee was not evident and the left knee appeared normal on plain radiography images. T2-weighted magnetic resonance images of the left thigh revealed a loss of continuity of the distal biceps femoris tendon at the musculotendinous junction surrounded by a hematoma with high signal intensity (). Isolated rupture of the distal part of the left biceps femoris tendon was diagnosed and surgical exploration proceeded under lumbar spinal anaesthesia. A lateral incision over the belly of the biceps femoris revealed that the biceps femoris tendon had completely ruptured at the musculotendinous junction (). The tear was repaired using a modified Kessler method with strong nonabsorbable sutures.\nThe knee was postoperatively immobilized in a plaster cast at 30° of flexion.

The patient had undergone cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis as a 32-year-old in Latin America and had moved to Japan for work approximately 3 years prior to his initial visit to our hospital. He had returned to Latin America once about 6 to 7 months before presenting at our clinic. When he went back to Japan, his weight had increased from 130 kg to 145 kg. He did not experience abdominal pain immediately after his return to Japan, but, as noted above, he started to gradually feel pain in the right lateral region about 2 months prior to presentation.\nHe first visited another hospital emergency department 1 month after onset of the pain. Initially, gastrointestinal tract spasm was suspected, and he was treated with tiquizium bromide. Though the medication partially relieved his abdominal pain, most of the pain persisted. The result of a workup by a urologist was negative, even though nephrolithiasis was suspected. His abdominal pain was exacerbated upon changing posture, and thus it was suspected to be of somatic rather than visceral origin.

The mass had been present for over 5 years and had gradually enlarged during this time. Recently, the lesion had increased in size rather rapidly.\nAt another treatment facility, when the patient was 18 years of age, she underwent debulking of a tumor from the right buttock, which was complicated with a very profuse intraoperative hemorrhage resulting in a severe hypotension and acute kidney failure requiring 8 units of blood for stabilization. The patient was later discharged and did not continue followup at that treatment facility. In spite of this, the mass in the right buttock and lumbar region continued undergoing slow growth until it limited her daily activities. Upon arriving at our center, physical examination revealed a large, firm, amorphous, fluctuant, soft tissue mass measuring 60 × 50 × 30 cm. that originated from the lumbar region and extended to the gluteal fold and overhanging from the posterior aspect of her thigh ().\nMRI was technically difficult due to the dimensions of the tumor. The extension of the mass was unable to be determined with certainty because portions of it remained outside of the field of view. The mass exhibited intermediate signal on both T1- and T2-weighted images, and several fluid collections were identified (). The images demonstrated multiple serpiginous flow voids in keeping with prominent vasculature. The mass did not infiltrate the underlying gluteal musculature. Core needle biopsy was performed and the results were consistent with PNF; there was no evidence of malignancy in the tissue sample.\nThe case was reviewed at our multidisciplinary musculoskeletal tumor committee. The treatment consensus opted for preoperative embolization, as this would potentially reduce the perioperative blood loss considering the vascularity and size of the lesion.

The patient was performing a one-rep max bench press when he felt a pop in his right upper arm, accompanied by severe pain. There was no history of anabolic steroid use. He was initially treated with ice and a sling by a trainer and presented to the emergency department for further evaluation. Plain films were negative for fracture or dislocation and the patient was neurovascularly intact, so he was discharged home by ER staff in the sling. He presented to the orthopedic clinic the following day with moderate pain in the chest and arm. He denied numbness and paresthesia. On physical examination, there was a large amount of swelling and ecchymoses throughout the right upper arm extending into the pectoralis major muscle belly. Additionally, there was a large bulge in the anterior chest with loss of contour of the axillary fold (). The patient had full active range of motion of the elbow, wrist, and digits. He was sensory intact throughout the right upper extremity with a 2+ radial pulse. An MRI was scheduled to determine the extent of the injury and to aid in surgical planning. The patient was given oxycodone and valium to alleviate the pain and muscle spasms until surgery, which was scheduled after his MRI. The MRI demonstrated avulsion of the pectoralis major tendon from its insertion on the humerus with retraction as well as strain of the anterior deltoid (Figures and ).

A chest radiograph showed a mass at the left hilum thought to be a neoplasm (see figure ). A misdiagnosis of haematemesis led to an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showing oesophagitis. He developed respiratory failure requiring ventilation. A subsequent bronchoscopy excluded a central bronchial tumour, confirmed by histopathologic examination of biopsies. He was transferred to a specialist centre where a CT and MRT scans of the thorax showed the mass to be infiltrating the left upper lobe and was suspicious for an aneurysm of a coronary artery (see figure ). Transthoracic echocardiography and MRI confirmed this impression and he proceeded to coronary angiography, which demonstrated a giant aneurysm from the LAD (figure ). He developed cardiovascular instability and proceeded emergently to surgery.\nThe procedure was performed using right atrial to aortic cardiopulmonary bypass via median sternotomy and opening of the anterior pericardium. The aneurysm was adherent to the left anterolateral pericardial aspect and was not disturbed until cardioplegic arrest was achieved, to avoid distal embolization in a beating heart. After achieving myocardial arrest the dissection was completed, revealing the aneurysm to have entry and exit openings into the proximal and mid LAD (see figure ), and there was compression of the left upper lobe with airway inflammation rather than invasion. The adherent pericardium was removed together with the aneurysm and a large quantity of thrombus, leaving a significant pericardial defect requiring Supple-Guard patch closure. The proximal and distal communications from the LAD to aneurysm were closed. A single end-to-side vein graft was performed in the mid LAD distal to the aneurysm (see figure ). After reperfusion and rewarming cardiopulmonary bypass was weaned without difficulty.

The total ischemia time was more than 10 hours of warm ischemia.\nAfter an external fixator was applied to the open tibial fracture and internal fixation was performed for the fibula, wound exploration was performed (). Thrombosis of the anterior tibial artery and a 20-cm-long segment of the artery's crushed intimal structure were observed, along with a similarly damaged vein. The posterior tibial vessels showed an arterial gap of 10 cm, with one accompanying vein ruptured and the other vein crushed with a venous gap of 7 cm (). The posterior tibial vessels appeared more promising for a successful repair. A lesser saphenous vein graft was harvested from the contralateral leg in a 12 cm segment for the arterial reconstruction (). After blood flow resumed, 400 mL of blood was drained before the vein was repaired.\nThe ruptured vein was repaired primarily, and the vein with a 7 cm gap was repaired with an 8 cm strip of arterial graft from a non-thrombosed segment at the middle portion of the thrombosed anterior tibial artery ().\nThe healthy vein graft was considered more reliable for the arterial reconstruction than the arterial graft from the damaged anterior tibial artery. Therefore, the posterior"}

The patient's history revealed a blow to her face after falling off a cliff during mountain biking. Her initial evaluation in Emergency Service reported that her general condition was poor, and her hemoglobin value was 6 mg/dL with severe maxillofacial trauma and bleeding. The patient had an emergency consultation at the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery after a rapid hemodynamic stabilization and CT scans. According to the medical records obtained from her physician, she had a severe soft tissue injury and accompanying comminuted bone fractures on bilateral maxilla, zygoma, periorbital area, mandible, and nasal bones. Bone fragments were fixed with titanium plates and screws without bone grafting. There was also a posterior vertical split fracture on the hard palate extending anteriorly to both sides creating a mobile free bone fragment on the anterior maxilla. Those fractures were also fixed after reconstruction and then soft tissue repair was done. Complications were not seen in the early postoperative period; however, followup of the patient indicated bone necrosis on the anterior maxilla including the alveolar process extending to the palate. After debridement of the necrosis process, the defect was reconstructed with mucosal flaps and bony reconstruction was postponed. The patient refused the bone graft surgery planned for the repair of the defect on the anterior maxilla and had been consulted for prosthetic treatment.\nHer clinical examination showed soft tissue defects on the face particularly eye area and dysmorphic appearance (). The panoramic radiograph demonstrated mini plates and screws used for fixing fractured zygomatic arch, orbital, and maxillary sinus walls. Intraoral examination revealed the absence of the anterior maxillary alveolar ridge and bone until the apex line; both maxillary central and lateral incisors and right canine teeth were lost as a result of traumatic injury ().\nThe patient had an Angle Class I occlusion with an acceptable vertical and horizontal overlap prior to the accident.

While working, an electric motor rolled on his right hand and forearm, resulting in swelling and abrasions on the dorsum of his hand and elbow. There were no fractures seen on radiographs. No surgery or sutures were needed. He complained of constant pain for 15 months. He was diagnosed with RSD without objective imaging conformation. He received a cervical epidural block 3 months after the injury, a stellate ganglion block 4 months after the injury, and an intravenous block 5 months after the injury. He stated that none of these treatments helped his pain. Seven months after the injury, a dorsal column stimulator was implanted, which he stated relieved 50% of the pain. The patient presented 15 months after the injury for a medical evaluation as part of workers’ compensation litigation process. He claimed constant pain and the inability to use his right hand and arm. Upon physical examination, the patient held his right hand in a clenched fist posture with his fingers overlapping. He held his elbow and wrist in a fixed flexed posture and adducted against his body, as shown in .\nHe would only abduct his arm minimally at the shoulder. It was noted that the patient was suntanned, including the axillary area on the right side and on his right chest. All finger nails appeared to be chewed short on both hands. He stated that he did not bite his nails on his right hand because he could not get his hand to his mouth. He claimed that he picked the nails of his right hand off with his left hand. He later stated that his right hand was too tender to be touched, yet there was no allodynia on examination. There was no obvious atrophy upon examination of the upper extremities. Mineralization of the bones was symmetrical on bilateral radiographs. The patient initially claimed that his right hand had been in this position for 6 months, while his w"}

The patient developed the deformity following some fracture around elbow in the childhood at the age of 8 years that was managed conservatively in plaster cast after closed reduction. On examination, the boy had 15° of cubitus varus deformity, full range of elbow movements, and no distal neural deficit.\nRadiograph showed an oblique joint line suggestive of varus deformity and evidence of old healed remodeled fracture line. Two foramina of 3-4 mm diameter were seen on anteroposterior view on a vertical plane. The distal hole had a sharp margins while proximal had indistinct margins, similar holes were seen in oblique view [].\nThis child was undertaken for lateral wedge corrective osteotomy at elbow, The lateral approach to the elbow between the flexor and extensor compartments was used to expose the site of osteotomy. When the perisoteum from the anterior surface of the lower humerus was lifted, some anomalous structure entering into the bone was noticed on the medial side of the supracondylar region. On further dissection it looked like neural tissue [], and was thought to be the median nerve. We attempted to make a window into the bone and free the nerve but it was seen that the nerve was severely entrapped in the bone and on our repeated attempts to remove it, it got transected. We planned to explore all the three nerves at the elbow to ascertain the identity of the nerve as its course was very aberrant. We explored both the median and the ulnar nerves and found them intact. We could not find the radial nerve in its normal course. Thus we got ascertained that the involved nerve was the radial nerve. We did the osteotomy as planned and closed the wound. The nerve was not repaired as it was found to be nonrepairable. Post operatively the function of both ulnar and median nerves was normal, but there was radial nerve palsy [Figure and ].\nThe elbow was mobilized after 1"}

He had no systemic symptoms nor signs and aside from his ocular complains was healthy. There was no swelling anywhere in the body and no itching. Upon ocular examination his visual acuity was 6/6 in both eyes. The only significant finding was the presence of an actively mobile worm in the nasal subconjunctival space of the right eye \"\". This worm soon migrated upwards towards the superior fornix and away from view during the examination and before removal could be attempted \"\". The patient was immediately asked to adopt a face down position and within 30minutes of this time; he could feel a crawling sensation again in the same eye indicating that the worm was back.

{"note": "A 9 year-old girl has been referred to our clinic because of popping in her right hip for 9 months. Her mother stated that the popping sound was so frequent and loud that was disturbing to the sleep of the family during the night for the last couple of months. Her mother had a normal pregnancy with vaginal delivery without any problem. According to the records, postnatal physical examination by pediatrician in hospital was normal. She was the first child of the family. There was no record of any congenital or connective tissue disease in the family. Past medical history of the patient was negative for trauma. Educational and school records were in normal range. According to the family history she did not have any problem until 9 months ago. The popping was started after separation of her parents. The patient was used to live with her mother afterward. Although the patient was able to produce popping voluntarily during the day but the chief complaint was the frequent and loud popping sound at night after falling asleep. The popping was painless. In physical examination there was no ligamentous laxity and the hip joints were painless, normal in range of motion and stable in all directions. We asked the patient to produce the popping. She positioned the right hip up to 90 degrees flexion and 15-20 degrees adduction, after doing a slight internal rotation we heard a sudden loud popping sound and hip was displaced in posterior direction. After dislocation she relocated the hip by external rotation and abduction. The maneuver was painless. Routine lab tests were normal. Pelvic and right hip radiographs were normal (, ). An anteroposterior radiograph after dislocation maneuver revealed hip dislocation with wide space between the femoral head and the acetabulum (). We discussed the problem and its nature with parents and referred the family to the psychological consultation. The family took part in sessions of family therapy. After 3 months the popping disappeared and did not recurred during 15 months of follow up period."}
{"note": "A 92-year-old man was referred to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery on a two-week wait basis for assessment of an ulcer on the tongue (). History revealed that the ulcer had been present for two months, was painful and causing discomfort while swallowing. The patient had lost seven kilograms of weight in one month, and he attributed this to the inability to eat due to pain. He had no significant relevant medical history. Social history revealed that he had been a pipe smoker for many years and took moderate amounts of alcohol on a regular basis.\nClinical examination of the head and neck region revealed a 3 cm diameter indurated ulcer of the left posterior dorsum of the tongue. This ulcer was highly suspicious of malignancy. Examination of the neck revealed an ipsilateral solitary lymph node of 4 cm diameter in level 3 region. The patient was informed of the possible diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. He underwent urgent incisional biopsy under local anaesthesia, and the histopathology report was suggestive of an adenocarcinoma (). Additional immunohistochemistry performed on the specimen demonstrated that the adenocarcinoma expressed cytokeratin 20 but lacked cytokeratin 7. In addition, the large bowel marker CDX2 was positive, whereas the pulmonary marker TTF1, the thyroid marker, thyroglobulin, and the prostate marker, PSA, were all negative. This suggested that the presenting oral lesion was the first sign of a possible distant metastasis of a primary bowel carcinoma.\nThe patient underwent further investigations; chest X-ray, MRI head and neck, and CT chest and abdomen. The CT demonstrated a sigmoid carcinoma with local lymphadenopathy and also evidence of distant metastasis to right axillary, hepatic, intrapulmonary, retroperitoneal, brain, and bony disease to the thoracic vertebra. This patient was discussed in the head and neck multidisciplinary team meeting and subsequently referred to colorectal team for treatment. The colorectal team confirmed the presence of rectosigmoid tumour on colonoscopy that proved histologically to be a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The patient was referred for palliation due to the extensive nature of his disease."}

The mass had started as a small swelling over the left maxillary alveolar ridge where excision had been done accordingly in the dental office. One month later, the mass had reappeared with rapid growth and had never regressed until a facial bulge was visible. On further history, the patient did not mention any problems with swallowing or respiration, and her past medical history was insignificant with no chronic illness and no prior history of exposure to radiation or chemotherapy and no history of benign bone conditions. Regarding her family history, there was no genetic predisposition or other malignancies. Furthermore, surgical and dental history was insignificant with no pharmacological medications and no history of allergies or smoking.\nOn physical examination, an irregular mass on the left anterior maxillary alveolar ridge measuring around 2 x 2 cm (Figure ) with a missed upper lateral incisor was noted. The overlying mucosa was intact and there was no ulceration. There was no pus coming out of the mass and examination of the cervical lymph nodes revealed no abnormalities. Upon radiological workup, there was no evidence of distant metastasis or any signs of other abnormality.\nThe recurrence of the mass warranted further investigation as an initial differential of osteomyelitis or other mixed lesions. After obtaining the patient’s written consent, an incisional biopsy was performed under local anaesthesia where the histopathology showed high-grade (G3), chondroblastic osteosarcoma (Figure ).\nWhen we discussed the surgical options and treatment with the patient, she was reluctant to follow the treatment protocol and chose to seek a second opinion.

These children were small for gestational age at birth and are the focus of this case report. Upon diagnosis of this rare disorder, the patient was treated with oral sirolimus 2mg twice daily. Her cutaneous lesions resolved significantly at 6 months follow up. She had a flare up of the lesions when she discontinued treatment before preconception. Her family history is unremarkable. She conceived naturally at one year of sirolimus therapy through a non-consanguineous marriage. Both the partners are of average built and denied tobacco, alcohol or substance use. In view of the previous flare up history following preconception planning, she was advised to continue sirolimus by the treating physician. Prenatal care for the first pregnancy included an ultrasound for determination of gestational age and routine monitoring of possible side effects of sirolimus. Regular blood investigation revealed normal complete blood count, liver and renal functions, sugar and lipid profile. Routine antenatal checkup done at the rural health care center by the Health Assistant were uneventful. Records maintained in the prenatal care book showed normal blood pressure, maternal weight gain, height of fundus corresponding to gestational age and normal hemoglobin level. Fetal ultrasound done at 36 weeks of gestation at the district hospital by a sonographer technician revealed a single live fetus with adequate amniotic fluid and expected fetal weight corresponding to 34 weeks. In view of maternal medical condition, sirolimus therapy and suspected fetal growth restriction, the mother was referred to the tertiary hospital. No gross anomalies were noted on limited anomaly examination and umbilical artery doppler study was within the normal range for the gestational age. At 40 weeks, she delivered a normal live male newborn weighing 2200 grams (<10th percentile on the customized fetal growth chart) with Apgar score of 9 and 10 at 1 and 10 minutes respectively.

The diameter of his middle esophageal diverticulum was 47 mm, and the accumulation of contrast medium was observed in the diverticulum. A gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a diverticulum in the right wall located 30 cm from the incisor row (Fig. ), and the diverticulum mucous membrane was partially covered by adherent white matter that was unstained with iodine (Fig. ), and narrowband imaging which revealed type A. We performed a biopsy, and the pathological findings of the endoscopic biopsy were atypical epithelium and no malignant findings. We confirmed the function of the lower esophageal sphincter, and the esophageal body peristaltic wave was observed to be normal using high-resolution manometry. We decided to perform a thoracoscopic diverticulectomy based on his symptoms and the possibility of malignancy suggested by the atypical epithelium.

An anterior internal fixation was conducted from the 6th cervical vertebra to the 1st thoracic vertebra on the day of the injury and a conservative treatment that involved maintaining a supine position was recommended. The patient was admitted to our hospital for rehabilitation treatment 99 days after the injury. The neurological level of injury was determined to be C5 according to the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment scale B. At that time, the patient was using an NG tube. A videofluoroscopic swallowing (VFS) test was attempted at 1 week after admission, but the test could not be performed because the patient could not remain in the required position. Hence, the test was performed 128 days after injury, after confirming that the patient could maintain the required position for the procedure. The oropharyngeal examination during the VFS test showed that the swallowing reflex and processes had progressed without any abnormal findings; therefore, the NG tube was removed and the oral feeding of a dysphagia diet was initiated.\nThe patient complained of swallowing during the feeding because of food stuck in the throat ; moreover, he experienced intermittent vomiting after the feeding. The ability to swallow at that time was estimated to be of grade 2 on the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) [].

The patient had undergone cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis as a 32-year-old in Latin America and had moved to Japan for work approximately 3 years prior to his initial visit to our hospital. He had returned to Latin America once about 6 to 7 months before presenting at our clinic. When he went back to Japan, his weight had increased from 130 kg to 145 kg. He did not experience abdominal pain immediately after his return to Japan, but, as noted above, he started to gradually feel pain in the right lateral region about 2 months prior to presentation.\nHe first visited another hospital emergency department 1 month after onset of the pain. Initially, gastrointestinal tract spasm was suspected, and he was treated with tiquizium bromide. Though the medication partially relieved his abdominal pain, most of the pain persisted. The result of a workup by a urologist was negative, even though nephrolithiasis was suspected. His abdominal pain was exacerbated upon changing posture, and thus it was suspected to be of somatic rather than visceral origin. Abdominal pain persisted despite treatment with loxoprofen sodium hydrate, and any cause of abdominal pain was not detected on further evaluations, including hematologic laboratory analysis, urine analysis, gastroscopy, or abdominal computed tomography (CT).

As he did so, he felt an immediate sharp pain and tearing sensation in his left elbow. Over the next week, he noted the development of significant swelling and ecchymosis in the left forearm and elbow. He reported that injury to his employer, but was not referred for medical attention. He continued working despite the swelling and pain, relying mostly on his dominant arm to perform his job duties. Over the next several months, the patient noted increasing weakness of elbow flexion and supination and increasing deformity of his left biceps relative to the right side. On presentation, he reported he was unable to lift objects weighing more than 1—pounds and he was not able to flex or supinate his forearm without pain and weakness. He also reported muscle spasm in the left bicep muscle and significant atrophy of the left biceps muscle compared to the right. His main complaint was a profound weakness, specifically with supination, and to a lesser degree with elbow flexion, to the point where he was forced to rely on his right arm for both work-related activities and activities of daily living. He denied any prior history of elbow pain or weakness before his injury.

The pain started gradually 10 months back and became very severe for the last 1 month. The intensity of pain was increasing in both the sitting and lying down positions and decreasing in a standing position. Many non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were tried earlier without much benefit. Over the last 1 month, the severity of the pain was so bad that the patient had to stand all the time and sitting or decubitus position was not tolerable even for 1 min. His sleep was so miserable that he had been taking small naps in that standing position leaning onto some support. He had carcinoma rectum for which he underwent abdominoperineal resection 8 years ago. There was history of smoking prior to that. After the surgery, he had been leading a near normal life driving auto rickshaw for a living until he developed the present problem. There were many gangrenous ulcers over his right thigh and leg. A computed tomography-angiogram was done previously that showed a thrombus in the right common iliac artery measuring about 9.5 cm extending up to the right superficial femoral artery with a near total occlusion of the lumen and poorly developed collaterals. He was scheduled for a conventional peripheral angiogram for deciding on the further plan. However, he could not lie down in the catheterization laboratory due to severe pain and was referred to our Department of Pain Management. We initially tried a conservative approach with a combination of oral pregabalin, diclofenac, paracetamol, and tramadol as per the standard dosage protocol for 2 days. When there was no satisfactory pain relief, we planned epidural analgesia. However, the problem here was the positioning.

He was initially treated with ice and a sling by a trainer and presented to the emergency department for further evaluation. Plain films were negative for fracture or dislocation and the patient was neurovascularly intact, so he was discharged home by ER staff in the sling. He presented to the orthopedic clinic the following day with moderate pain in the chest and arm. He denied numbness and paresthesia. On physical examination, there was a large amount of swelling and ecchymoses throughout the right upper arm extending into the pectoralis major muscle belly. Additionally, there was a large bulge in the anterior chest with loss of contour of the axillary fold (). The patient had full active range of motion of the elbow, wrist, and digits. He was sensory intact throughout the right upper extremity with a 2+ radial pulse. An MRI was scheduled to determine the extent of the injury and to aid in surgical planning. The patient was given oxycodone and valium to alleviate the pain and muscle spasms until surgery, which was scheduled after his MRI. The MRI demonstrated avulsion of the pectoralis major tendon from its insertion on the humerus with retraction as well as strain of the anterior deltoid (Figures and ).

The pain was associated with numbness of the right side of his face, especially in the vicinity of the mandibular nerve which could be triggered with drinking cold water. Considering his poor orodental hygiene, decayed teeth had been diagnosed to be the cause of pain and lead to the extraction of several of the right upper and lower teeth while he was also treated with antibiotics for gingivitis for a long period of time.\nTwo days before admission, he developed generalized tonic colonic seizure. Neurological examination revealed bilateral papilledema and mild paresthesia detectable along the distribution area of the mandibular nerve especially over the labial commissure. MRI revealed a large right temporal mass with nonhomogenous postcontrast enhancement, invading the wall of the right cavernous sinus, and spreading down to the right CPA. The enhancing bundle in the right CPA was compatible with the thickened course of the fifth nerve extending to the surface of the pons [Figures and ].\nA right temporal craniotomy was performed and a solid fleshy tumor infiltrating the dura of the floor of the right temporal fossa and lateral wall of the cavernous sinus could be resected as much as possible. The deepest part of the tumor could be excised as a layer of the tumor infiltrating the surface of the cavernous sinus. We stopped just over the tentorium and no dissection was done beyond this point. The contrast-enhanced CT scan and MRI performed in the postoperative period revealed a minimal residual tumor in the right CPA, located along the course of the right trigeminal nerve [].\nThe postoperative course was uneventful and a histopathological examination revealed the tumor to be GBM. The patient received postoperative whole brain radiotherapy. Five weeks after surgery, the patient was pain free but numbness of the face persisted for another 6 months. The patient died 17 months"}
{"note": "The patient was a 61-day-old girl. She was born at a gestational age of 37 weeks and had a birth weight of 2.41 kg. She had a slightly high galactose concentration on mass screening for congenital metabolic abnormalities at 4 days of age. She was examined at another hospital at 13 days of age, when she exhibited white feces and a high circulating direct bilirubin concentration. Her gallbladder could not be identified by abdominal ultrasonography; therefore, biliary atresia was suspected. At the age of 39 days, bile excretion was not observed on hepatobiliary scintigraphy, and hepatobiliary scintigraphy at the previous hospital had not confirmed excretion into the intestinal tract. Due to the novel coronavirus pandemic and the circumstances of the family, her referral to our hospital was slightly delayed. The patient was admitted to our department at the age of 57 days and underwent exploratory laparotomy at the age of 61 days, when she was diagnosed with type III biliary atresia (the type of extrahepatic biliary obstruction was determined using the Japanese Society of Pediatric Surgeons Classification\n) using intraoperative cholangiography (\n) and underwent open KPE using the 8K UHD television system.\nA right subcostal laparotomy was performed and intraoperative cholangiography was performed via the atrophied gallbladder. Only the gallbladder could be detected, and the contrast agent leaked from the lateral aspect under compression. A diagnosis of type III biliary atresia was made on the basis of the cholangiographic and gross findings, and open KPE was performed.\nThe connective tissue in the portal region was dissected using Metzenbaum scissors at the level of the hepatic capsule, from the medial side of the left portal vein toward the medial side of the right portal vein, while applying gauze saturated with warm physiological saline to aid hemostasis.\nAt that time, the site of dissection was confirmed by examining the portal region using the camera of the 8K UHD laparoscopic system, and the biliary outflow site was examined after dissection.

A physician could use the proposed system for this patient following the four steps outlined in . The six drugs amongst the list of drugs that the patient was taking on the symptom start date, were found to be related to vomiting according to the database. Among the six drugs, Tramadol HCI was the most highly ranked according to the decision tree model, and thus would have been recommended as the main culprit drug. In addition to the name of candidate drugs/substances, the system displayed more information on the drug such as the frequency and severity of the symptom. The physician could have chosen any drug from the list of recommendations based on past treatments and medications on the particular patient. In this case, the physician would have accepted the recommendation, and hence entered a prescription change for the selected drug in step 3. Finally, the physician would have reported the outcome of the prescription change a few days later, i.e., assessment of the causality between vomiting and Tramadol HCI as probable/likely (50%). This result would have been stored and used later for patients with symptoms and demographics similar to the ones of this patient.\npresents the decision tree and the rules that were used to provide the recommendations. This shows how the six drugs were ranked as listed in step 2 (), more specifically why Tramadol HCI was recommended as the most likely cause of an adverse event. According to the decision tree, medical department was the most important factor to identify ADE causative drugs. If we consider the case of the patients from the department of neurosurgery, there were only two patients in the same group as the patient of case 1 (i.e., age between 71 and 80 and gender=male) due to a limited dataset. While not enough data are available, the highlighted rule clearly shows that a patient similar to both of them may"}

He had not received treatment because he was asymptomatic. Eight months earlier, he experienced chest discomfort after eating and visited our hospital. His past history is pediatric asthma. The diameter of his middle esophageal diverticulum was 47 mm, and the accumulation of contrast medium was observed in the diverticulum. A gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a diverticulum in the right wall located 30 cm from the incisor row (Fig. ), and the diverticulum mucous membrane was partially covered by adherent white matter that was unstained with iodine (Fig. ), and narrowband imaging which revealed type A. We performed a biopsy, and the pathological findings of the endoscopic biopsy were atypical epithelium and no malignant findings. We confirmed the function of the lower esophageal sphincter, and the esophageal body peristaltic wave was observed to be normal using high-resolution manometry. We decided to perform a thoracoscopic diverticulectomy based on his symptoms and the possibility of malignancy suggested by the atypical epithelium. Surgery was performed with the patient placed in the prone position and four trocars inserted into the right thoracic cavity. A 12-mm trocar was inserted into the fifth intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. Only the left lung was ventilated, and a pneumothorax in the right chest was created using CO2 gas at 6 mm. Twelve-mm trocars were inserted into the seventh and ninth intercostal spaces at the level of the inferior scapular angle.

She first noticed the swelling a year previously and attended her local doctor who felt it was a ganglion. Past medical history included hypertension, osteoarthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica and malunion of a right distal radius following a distal radius fracture sustained 5 months prior for which she declined surgical intervention (,). Clinical examination revealed a radially deviated wrist with a classic dinner fork deformity. There was a 6 X 9 cm round painless mass on the dorsum of the distal radius adherent to both the underlying structures and skin which did not transilluminate and with necrotic area of overlying skin (,). General physical e x a m i n a t i o n w a s u n r e m a r k a b l e w i t h n o o b v i o u s lymphadenopathy, no breast masses, no organomegaly and clear lung fields.

Blood count, renal and liver function were within normal range, ESR 74 (elevated), haemoglobin 11 g/dl. On ultrasound scan there was a large vascularised soft tissue mass infiltrating the tendinous structures on the dorsum of the right wrist. MRI of the wrist showed a large mass causing extensive osteolysis of the distal radius and extending proximally with abnormal replacement of the marrow in the distal one third of the radius. The soft tissue component of the mass involved the entire extensor tendon groups and infiltrated through the subcutaneous tissues to the dermis (,,).

{"note": "A 68-year-old man with no significant medical problems was referred by his primary care physician with a 6-month history of a painful right hip. The pain was localized above the right hip joint and a mass with bony consistency was palpable just above the anterior superior iliac spine. On pelvic x-ray (Fig. ) an exostosis overlying the lateral superior border of the right iliac bone was seen and radiological features on magnetic resonance imaging scan (Fig. ) were in keeping with an osteosarcoma. Biochemical markers including a serum prostate specific antigen concentration was within normal limits. Subsequent biopsy and histopathological analysis of this lesion performed at the regional sarcoma centre showed this to be an adenocarcinoma of metastatic origin. On further staining there were features to suggest mucin production and it was positive for cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) suggesting a colorectal origin (Figs and ) thereby ruling out a sarcoma. CK20 is a marker of intestinal differentiation, and its expression is highly characteristic of colorectal primary. CDX2 protein is a member of the homeobox genes that encodes an intestine-specific transcription factor and it is an excellent marker for adenocarcinomas arising from the colon.\nStaging computerized tomography scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis (Fig. ) did not reveal a primary source but identified thickening of the ascending colon. A subsequent colonoscopy (Figs and ) identified this thickened area as a hepatic flexure adenocarcinoma with mucin production confirmed on histopathological analysis ( and ). Comparison with the histopathology from the bone biopsy confirmed that the bone lesion was a secondary deposit from the colonic adenocarcinoma. Our patient did not have any other clinical or radiological evidence of metastatic spread to other organs like liver, lung or indeed other bones. On further analysis of the colonic tumour it was found that there was no pathogenic mutation in the K-RAS and N-RAS gene.\nThis is a report of an unusual presentation of metastatic colonic cancer as a solitary bony lesion mimicking a sarcoma.

The patient was Caucasian, had a body mass index (BMI)<20 and no history of endocrinopathy. The patient was evaluated by an orthopaedic surgeon who diagnosed him with an acute unstable SCFE and took the patient to surgery for a percutaneous in-situ fixation. The procedure was uncomplicated with appropriate center-center positioning of the screw within the head and epiphysis [ and ]. The patient returned home with his family at the conclusion of their vacation and followed up with a local orthopaedic surgeon (senior author).\nAt 3 weeks he was ambulating without difficulty when he developed recurrent pain and inability to weight-bear. New X-rays were obtained that demonstrated failure of the hardware with progression of the SCFE displacement, with a Grade 3 slip angle measured at 60 degrees [ and ]. The patient was taken back to surgery for hardware removal and revision closed reduction and percutaneous pinning of the SCFE. Surgical dislocation of the hip with hardware removal, open reduction and pinning was the also listed on the consent if the closed procedure failed. Insitu pinning and remodeling was deemed unlikely to have a successful outcome due to less then 3 years remaining until the patient turned 16 and the patient already achieving nearly the same height as his father and skeletally mature older brother.\nThe patient was brought to the operating room and placed on a fracture table in the supine position. Under fluoroscopic guidance minimal traction was applied to the left leg through the boot harness and the leg was internally rotated so that on both AP and lateral images the long axis of the screw shaft and the distal screw fragment within the epiphysis were co-axial. A guide wire was then threaded back through the screw allowing the cannulated screw driver to be easily seated within the screw head and the proximal screw fragment was removed."}

The lower back pain started when the patient fell down nine years ago. At first, mild lower back pain had occurred from time to time, but severe pain with a visual analogue score (VAS) of 8 or higher started to occur three months prior to her visit. The patient did not have any particular medical history except osteoporosis diagnosed in her late fifties. She felt pain as if her body was collapsing or sinking, accompanied by pulling pain at the hip and groin. The pain became more severe when standing up and moving, and relieved when lying down at rest. The physical examination showed tenderness at the first lumbar (L1) spinous process region. There were no abnormal findings in any other neurological examinations. The plain radiograph showed severe osteoporosis over the vertebral bodies, a severe compression fracture of the L1 vertebral body in which the anterior compression rate was 70% or higher, and an intravertebral vacuum cleft in the vertebral body (). Magnetic resonance imaging showed a low signal area of L1 in the T1 weighted image and a high signal in the T2 weighted image ().\nDespite conservative treatment for more than four weeks including continuous epidural pain control, the patient's pain did not decrease and she was rejecting surgical procedures such as a spinal fusion. Although the case was not a general indication of percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty due to the severe collapse of the vertebral body, we decided to do transpedicular kyphoplasty using this method to block the cement outflow by slowly injecting highly viscous bone cement.\nBefore the procedure, cefazolin 1 g was intravenously injected to the patient as a preventive antibiotic.

She was noted to have the phenotypic features indicative of Smith-Magenis syndrome at the age of three years and the diagnosis was confirmed with chromosomal studies. There was no family history of syndromic conditions or scoliosis.\nThe development of a scoliosis was first noted at the age of 4 years and the patient was treated with an underarm spinal brace in another spinal centre. The deformity remained stable up to the age of 10 years when the curvature progressed rapidly as the patient started going through her pubertal growth spurt. During that stage, the brace was discontinued as the patient's compliance was very poor and any brace effectiveness was limited due to the fact that the patient was significantly overweight. At presentation to our clinic, she remained premenarchal with a body weight of 63 kg which was above the 95th percentile for sex- and age-matched normal population. Her arm span was 142 cm which was between the 25th and 50th percentiles for stature and her BMI was calculated to be 31.2.\nOn clinical examination, the patient was found to be very hyperactive. Overall, she had a balanced spine with level shoulders and pelvis despite a mild thoracic translocation to the right and no leg length discrepancy. However, she had a severe thoracic and lumbar deformity with a significant rib hump adjacent to the convexity of the thoracic scoliosis, as well as a marked waist line asymmetry with prominence of the pelvis on the concavity of the lumbar curve. There were no skin or soft tissue abnormalities overlying the spine. The patient was a community ambulator and had no neurological abnormality.

The patient had noticed the mass more than one year before presenting but had sought help of alternative medicine (homeopathy) in her village and was on homeopathic medication for almost a year. The size of the lump did reduce initially, but she did not notice any improvement after a year of therapy; instead the mass grew more rapidly and erupted through the skin. She delayed medical attention because she was not comfortable discussing her condition. She sought help when the mass erupted through the skin and caused pain.\nPhysical examination presented a hanging mass which was ulcerated, having irregular surface and nodular appearance, occupying the lower and outer quadrant of the right breast (). The right breast was asymmetrically drawn down by the mass, which was firm in consistency and was found attached to the underlying structures by a stalk-like process. The mass bled on touch. There was no discharge from the nipple and retraction of nipple was also absent. There were no signs of skin involvement or axillary lymphadenomegaly. The left breast was normal.\nThe patient was subjected to diagnostic investigations which included routine as well as imaging and cytological modalities. Blood examination revealed no abnormality except mildly elevated ESR and all other parameters were within normal limits. Ultrasonography reported the mass as an exophytic growth with heterogeneous echotexture and vascularity. Chest X-rays and abdominal ultrasound were performed which showed no abnormality.

The patient had developed end-stage renal disease secondary to lupus nephritis. She had a medical history of bilateral thrombosis of both common and external iliac arteries due to lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid antibodies that had required bilateral percutaneous angioplasty with wall stenting. The medical workup had documented thrombosis of both iliac veins and of the lower portion of the lower part of the inferior vena cava as well as extensive atherosclerotic lesions of the abdominal aorta. In addition, she had a history of mitral valve replacement with a St. Jude prosthetic valve and received anticoagulation therapy with acenocoumarol.\nThe patient had an HLA semi-identical sister who was willing to donate a kidney. The donor workup had documented a slightly lower tubular mass of the right kidney which was chosen for procurement. The “classic” extraperitoneal pelvic transplantation of a kidney graft was contraindicated because of stented iliac arteries and extended atheromatosis of the aorta (). An alternative surgical technique with the transplantation of the graft into the location of a native kidney was proposed to the recipient and her sister who both consented to the procedure. Mapping CT-angiography of the recipient showed that the left renal artery was appropriated for anastomosis with the graft artery. At the same time the anatomical variant of the left recipient renal vein was found with low implantation to vein cava inferior (VCI; ).\nThe graft was procured by laparoscopic right donor transperitoneal nephrectomy with utilization of linear stapler Endo-GIA as previously described [].

The lesion had a diameter of 8 mm and was located at the midline anterior portion of the ventral surface of the tongue and seemed to have the impression of the teeth on its center due to repetitive trauma resulting from raking movements of the tongue against the anterior natal teeth leading to the clinical diagnosis of Riga-Fede Disease.\nThe mother refused permission to perform radiographic examination and tongue biopsy of the child; thus it was not possible at the time to identify if the teeth were supernumerary or regular primary teeth and the histopathological diagnosis of the lesion was not executed.\nThe tooth located on the left side presented grade II mobility, with risk of displacement and consequent swallowing or aspiration, leading to the option of surgical removal (). The tooth on the right side with regular mobility was preserved. To prevent the repetition of the trauma on the tongue and to allow wound healing, a small increment of glass ionomer cement was added, covering the cutting edge of that tooth.

However, the parents were planning for a second child and had a DNA test done in England when the patient was 10 and confirmed an 8p23 deletion. According to the past history, there were no abnormalities that accompanied the genetic disorder such as asthma, and DNA tests were done on the parents for a family history but all were normal. Based on the physical exam, the patient exhibited the characteristic facial features of microcephaly with a broad nasal bridge, short neck, and high arched palate. According to the airway examination, the interincisional distance was approximately 3 cm and the thyromental distance was approximately 5 cm when the mouth was opened at its widest maximum. The Mallampati airway classification was grade 3 and difficulty in intubation was predicted; there were no limitations in neck movement and there were no loose teeth but they were irregular. In an echocardiography conducted at another hospital, the patient had no heart problems that can accompany 50% of the people with deletion 8p23 syndrome, and there were no indication of Ebstein's malformation and TOF.

This worked reasonably well to control his neuralgic pain and he was able to continue doing his job until later part of 2020, when he started seeing his primary care physician more frequently. His symptoms gradually became more pronounced and frequent. He was now no longer able to work his usual job and had severe frequent intermittent episodes of left-sided facial pain. He subsequently had minimal oral intake and was barely able to sleep enough. By this time, his PCP had maximized his dose of carbamazepine but it failed to achieve any improvement. An outpatient trial of gabapentin, phenytoin, opioids, and NSAIDs had also been unsuccessful. In a span of 10 days, he had three ER visits before he was finally hospitalized with intractable pain and subsequent suicidal ideations. Family history of chiari malformation was reported in one of the siblings. His physical exam on initial presentation included normal vital signs. Neurological examination was pertinent with hyperalgesia reported along with the left lower V1 and throughout the entire left V2 cranial nerve distribution.\nMany therapeutic interventions were tried, including escalating doses of intravenous opioids, fosphenytoin loads and subcutaneous triptans but with minimal relief.

A mass on the ear had existed from birth, and the size of the mass had recently shown a slight increase. The patient had no history of trauma, family history, or other associated abnormalities. On the physical examination, an obviously raised lump measuring approximately 2×2 cm in size was found at the upper part and back of the helix. The surface of skin on the mass appeared to be normal, except for a slight redness and skin findings of fistula or skin adhesions were not observed. Because this patient is a child, surgery was performed under general anesthesia with an incision parallel to the auricle and parallel to the longitudinal axis of the mass at the back of helix. Because adhesion of helix cartilage to surrounding tissues was minimal, the skin covering the mass was raised easily. Helix cartilage on the mass was removed easily, however, an unusual depression was found on the helix cartilage. The mass was encapsulated; it was a cystic mass and cheese-like sebum was observed during dissection.\nHistological examination showed that the encapsulated film was composed of stratified squamous epithelium, and the inside of the cyst was composed of a keratinous cyst with laminated keratin material, however, adnexal structures of skin, such as hair and sweat glands, were not observed. Thus, it was diagnosed as an epidermoid cyst and invasion of acute and chronic inflammatory cells was observed around the mass. Skin suture was performed after excision of the mass, and no other procedure was required for treatment of depressed cartilage. Until three months after surgery, no complication such as inflammation was observed, however, at approximately one-year follow-up after surgery, two masses were observed at the top of the ipsilateral helix.

{"note": "A 62-year-old man attended his routine 1 year follow-up consultation following an uncomplicated UKR with a mobile bearing. During this appointment, the patient reported an uneventful initial recovery followed by an on-going pain and swelling in the posterior aspect of his knee, which started around 9 months after his surgery. He noted that the symptoms had evolved to a more constant background ache with consistent activity related pain alongside more stiffness over the last month.\nThe pain triggered his attendance to a community hospital on multiple occasions. The patient reported no specific history of trauma, but he remembers tripping while walking around the time of onset of recurrent symptoms. He complained of variable pain at the back of his knee which would ease, but never fully resolved. The main area of discomfort was around the medial hamstring tendons. At every attendance to the community hospital, he was assessed and reassured that this was most likely to be a hamstring strain and consequently, discharged with analgesia without any requirement of further investigation or discussion with our arthroplasty department.\nAt the 1 year follow-up appointment, radiographs (Fig. 4) were obtained which indicated that the polyethylene inserted was in fact dislocated posteriorly toward the popliteal fossa, into soft tissues adjacent to the neurovascular bundle, with consequent direct contact of metal components.\nClinical examination revealed a moderately swollen knee with a minimal effusion, with the affected limb noted to be in a greater varus alignment at the knee compared to the other leg. The range of motion was 10–125° with no noted major instability, and the varus was not fully correctable. There was moderate tenderness in the medial proximal tibia and distal femur as well as tenderness and focal swelling in the medial aspect of his popliteal fossa and medial hamstring tendon area.\nThe patient underwent a surgical exploration which revealed that both the femoral and tibial components were severely abraded, with consequent severe metallosis within the synovium.

The patient appeared physically healthy, but mild mental retardation was obvious. In the medical history, he had childhood asthma which ameliorated by the age of seven. No history of trauma or hereditary involvement was reported. The patient showed a straight profile and a symmetric face without abnormal findings in extraoral examinations. Clinical intraoral examinations revealed permanent dentition with poor oral hygiene and multiple caries. The molar relationship was Angle class I in both sides. Maxillary and mandibular arcs were U-shaped with both midlines on (). In the anterior maxillary region, we came to the rare finding of twinning in both central incisors. Both centrals showed an abnormally large mesiodistal width. No lateral incisor existed in the right maxillary region. Instead, a mesiodistally large central existed with a dental projection on its palatal side extending from the cingulum and ending at a small groove in the incisor edge (Figures and ). At the left side of the anterior maxilla, both central and lateral incisors existed. The left maxillary incisor also showed a large mesiodistal width with a large groove on the palatal surface that extended up to the incisal edge (Figures and ). There was no tooth mobility and no tenderness to percussion and palpation tests. A severe response to cold and electric tests was observed in the anterior maxillary incisor teeth. History taking revealed that he has had a previous endodontic treatment of a maxillary premolar in the same department. Reference to his file showed that his mother had been advised to refer to restoring caries in other teeth. She had also been suggested to seal the palatal grooves of the left incisor and esthetic treatment in maxillary anterior region. Because of poor socioeconomic status, further treatment was delayed until pain occurred. A panoramic radiograph was prescribed to detect possible further anomalies and define the condition in the anterior maxillary"}

CT scan revealed a well defined lesion with area of calcification in the right cerebellum []. There was a right to left shift of the fourth ventricle and severe obstructive hydrocephalus. After a shunting procedure the patient regained full consciousness. Further neurological examination revealed paralysis of right facial nerve, right sided dysmetria and dysdiadokokinesia neck stiffness and nystagmus. Deep reflexes were increased bilaterally. There was no papilledema. There were no cutaneous lesions or significant family history suggesting the diagnosis. A diagnosis of right cerebellar tumor was made and surgical removal was performed three days following shunting procedure.\nRight sub occipital craniotomy was performed. After retracting normal cerebellar tissue, we observed widened and well preserved cerebellar folia with a consistency comparable to a glioma. The tumor tissue was pale gray and poorly vascularized. As we went deeper, the border between tumor and normal cerebellar tissue was clearly distinguished. Further surgical exploration revealed that the lesion involved only the cerebellar folia; there was no infiltration of the medulla, pons and cranial nerves. Gross total tumor removal was achieved in this case.\nThe patient made uneventful recovery. Facial nerve paralysis remained but swallowing difficulties were reduced. On discharge, the patient was able to walk although a little unstable and had no difficulty swallowing. Over the following six month period there was complete resolution of all neurological deficits except for very mild paralysis of the right facial nerve. Control MRI three months after surgery at a private hospital revealed total tumor removal and the brain stem has resumed almost normal size and position [Figure and ].\nSection of the tumor mass revealed relatively well preservation of the cerebellar architecture with widened and distorted folia [].

{"note": "This patient was a male in his early sixties. He was admitted to an integrative ward of a University Hospital, with a progressing two-vessel coronary heart disease. The patient was scheduled for bypass surgery. The medical history of the patient comprised a Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. A percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and a stent implantation had been conducted in the past.\nIn a short interview preceding the LAVA assessment the patient reported that he had noticed a worsening of his coronary disease under physical exertion in his daily life before hospitalization. Nevertheless, the extent of deterioration that was diagnosed during his hospitalization, surprised him and he described an uncertainty because he did not know what might have caused the worsening of his disease nor how to positively influence the progression of the disease (e.g., life style modifications).\nFigure shows the LAVA self-assessment of the patient.\nWhen using the LAVA-Tool the patient rated eight terms as very important for his life. The three topics the patient was most dissatisfied with were mobility, contact to nature, and the ability to make decisions independently. The negative rating of mobility and contact with nature were probably influenced by the patient’s current situation in the hospital and by his disease. However, his dissatisfaction with his ability to make decisions independently could be attributed to his lack of knowledge concerning his disease and the expected improvement of his condition and mobility after the bypass surgery. A patient consultation that focused on a shared decision and understanding of the link between the treatment aims and his current negative experiences in life could therefore be helpful.\nFor this patient, the application of the LAVA tool led to the conclusion that the patient had a need for information. In this case, more information about the disease and the planned surgical intervention could probably help the patient to reduce his uncertainty and to feel more empowered to actively participate in his treatment. In the preceding interview the importance of the information need was not fully captured by the interviewer. The"}
{"note": "A 60-year-old man presented with a 16×6 cm2 open wound with an accompanying tibiofibular fracture due to a traffic accident. Free flap coverage was planned, with a necessary pedicle length of 14 cm from the middle of the flap to the recipient vessel and 9 cm from the flap margin. A 20×6 cm2 ALT flap from the patient’s ipsilateral thigh was planned. The perforator that branched at the proximal descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery was found intraoperatively (). The length of the branched perforator was 7 cm, and the available length of the descending branch on the proximal side was 2 cm, so the estimated pedicle length was 9 cm (). For pedicle length extension, dissection was performed on the distal aspect, which resulted in obtaining 7 cm of the distal descending branch. Thus, we were able to obtain a reverse ALT free flap with a total pedicle length of 14 cm in the distal direction. Before elevating the reverse ALT free flap, we clamped the proximal descending branch to check for flap circulation. We confirmed that flap congestion was present due to impaired retrograde flow through the valves of the vena comitans in the distal direction. To resolve flap congestion, one of the venae comitantes of the distal descending branch was isolated and connected to the proximal venous stump in an antegrade manner (). When connecting a 1.5-mm vena comitans of the distal descending branch with the 2-mm proximal venous stump, the diameter discrepancy of the venous anastomosis was not significant (). A modified ALT flap pedicle 15 cm in length was formed to prevent venous congestion and to ensure adequate length to reach the recipient vessel. As a result, the direction of the arterial flow to the flap was retrograde, and the venous flow was antegrade. To evaluate the flap condition after surgery, the flap color was checked and the pin-prick test and Doppler ultrasonography were performed. For 2 days after surgery, the flap status was maintained, with no findings of congestion or insufficiency."}
{"note": "A 30-year-old Indian man was brought to our Emergency Room after a road traffic accident, in which he was riding a motorcycle and was hit by a truck at a speed of approximately 50 miles per hour. Our patient complained of pain in his right arm and the inability to move it. An examination of his extremities revealed contusions over his right upper arm without any evidence of penetrating injury. There was marked swelling and tenderness in the middle part of his right arm associated with a closed injury. His cranial nerves were intact and no neurological deficits were present. No injures were found in his other limbs. In view of the above clinical findings, a radiograph of his right upper limb and a computed tomography (CT) scan of his head were suggested. While the CT scan did not reveal any abnormality, the radiograph of his right arm showed a unilateral displaced comminuted fracture of the mid shaft of his humerus (Figure ). Our patient was then given first aid in the form of a U-slab and immediately transferred to our orthopedic ward for further evaluation. His laboratory results were normal. Liver and kidney function test values were within their normal range. An electrocardiogram did not show any abnormal features.\nOur patient complained of tingling and numbness in his right little and ring fingers the following morning. On examination, there was hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal joints and flexion at the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints with an inability to move his little and ring finger (Figure ). With the suspicion of an ulnar nerve injury due to the accident, a series of nerve conduction studies of his right upper arm nerves were suggested. The electrodiagnostic evaluation demonstrated a severe ulnar nerve conduction block along his arm with normal amplitudes of conduction along the median and the radial nerves.\nCorrelating the clinical findings with the above radiological and nerve conduction findings, a diagnosis of ulnar nerve injury after the fracture of the shaft of the humerus was made.

His medical history showed that he had allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis that had been treated until 3 months previously by an otolaryngologist.\nThe patient initially visited our outpatient clinic with complaints of high fever, sore throat, and comorbid right cheek pain and mild swelling 6 weeks previously. A checkup at a dental clinic performed on the day before this initial visit revealed no abnormal findings. He showed clinical symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis. A rapid antigen test for group A streptococcal infection showed positive results. The patient was diagnosed with streptococcal infection. Facial cellulitis was also suspected and treatment with amoxicillin helped improve symptoms. However, facial pain recurred within 4 weeks of the initial visit. The patient had mild tenderness and swelling of the right cheek. Head computed tomography revealed mild mucous membrane swelling and effusion in both sinuses ( left). Because recurrence of cellulitis with sinusitis was suspected, cefditoren pivoxil treatment was initiated. However, because the pain persisted, he visited our department.\nPhysical examination revealed no abnormal findings except right cheek tenderness in the area that corresponded with the region supplied by the second branch of the trigeminal nerve (the maximally nerve). Although marked tenderness was evident, no point with hyperalgesia, where a light touch elicited severe pain, was observed. No facial paralysis or oral disorders were observed. Blood examination revealed no abnormal findings. Recurrence of sinusitis was suspected. Based on the physical examination and laboratory tests, the patient was clinically diagnosed with TN. Subsequently, oral clarithromycin administration was initiated for sinusitis that might have caused or exacerbated TN. However, administration of clarithromycin for 1 week was not effective for his facial pain. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no neurovascular compression ( right), which ruled out idiopathic, classical TN. During this time, we interviewed the patient on the nature of the right cheek pain. The patient described the pain as persistent, n"}

Her medical history included hypertension and a cardiac murmur, which had already been diagnosed during a medical examination when she was 18 years old. In 1991, she was evaluated because of symptoms of dizziness and near collapse during exertion. Besides systolic hypertension, no structural heart disease was found except for a mild aortic regurgitation and a peak systolic pressure gradient of 17 mmHg (heart rate 68 beats/min) over the aortic valve. She was treated with antihypertensive drugs and visited her cardiologist on a regular, yearly basis. Because of therapy refractory hypertension she was also referred to the internist to exclude underlying causes of her hypertension, but no underlying cause was diagnosed. When she was 50 years old, she stopped smoking because mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was diagnosed. At that time echocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy (septum en posterior wall diameter both 12 mm) with normal systolic function, still a mild aortic regurgitation and a peak systolic pressure gradient across the aortic valve of 28 mmHg (heart rate 64 beats/min). In the meantime, she was treated with four different antihypertensive drugs, but she remained hypertensive. To evaluate her complaints of angina in 2007 a nuclear exercise stress test was performed, which showed signs of reversible perfusion defects in the inferior, posterior and lateral walls suggestive of myocardial ischaemia. During following cardiac catheterisation, via the right femoral artery, the catheter could not be advanced up the ascending aorta because of a discrete narrowing of the aorta (Fig. ). Catheterisation performed via the radial artery showed a significant stenosis in the circumflex artery which was subsequently dilated and stented. The calculated peak pressure gradient across the narrowed thoracic aorta was 30 mmHg. Additional computed tomography (CT) scan of the aorta confirmed the diagnosis of coarctation with a pinpoint stenosis in the aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery. Moreover, an extensive collateral network, mainly consisting of bronchial and lumbar arteries, was seen (Fig"}

There was no complaint of cold sensitivity to the mass. The pain occasionally radiated down the ulnar aspect of her wrist. She had no known history of previous trauma to this area; however, she did have a history of squamous cell carcinoma to the dorsal-radial aspect of that hand. This had been treated previously for which she subsequently developed a reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), resulting in a delayed recovery in the range of motion. A previous stellate ganglion block did not provide relief for her RSD, and her range of motion had been slowly progressing with home exercises.\nOn physical exam, a small round nodule approximately 5 mm x 5 mm was palpable dorsal to the extensor carpi ulnaris and 1 cm proximal to the ulnar styloid. There was significant point tenderness that did not radiate or display a Tinel’s sign.

Since there was no history of trauma and the CT did not look like a traumatic splenic laceration the oncology service was contacted who felt that the findings were most compatible with lymphoma and because there was some bleeding going on did not recommend trying to treat it without a tissue diagnosis.\nThe patient underwent a splenectomy. He was found to have a massively enlarged spleen with areas where it appeared to be tumor extruding through the splenic capsule. There was a lot of ecchymotic tissue inferior to where the spleen had been and there was slight oozing which was controlled as much as possible as the area was quite friable. The tail of the pancreas was identified and left alone as there was no bleeding. The estimated blood loss was approx 2 L.\nFollowing extubation the patient had some issues with agitation which was attributable to ETOH withdrawal. The patient had a history of 6pack qd ETOH abuse. He was placed on CIWA protocol. His mental status remained at the level of agitation and confusion for the next 4 days not helped by serax or ativan or haldol.

He was well for the last 14 months and returned to his job without any pain or functional disability. However, he started experiencing deep-seated pain within the left knee with restriction of movements for the last 4 weeks. There was no recent history of any fall or trauma to the left knee. Clinical examination of the left knee revealed no patella or joint line tenderness but pieces of wires were palpable percutaneously. There was no effusion and the cruciate and collateral ligaments were intact; there was no neurovascular deficit. There was no extensor lag and knee extension power was normal. The range of motion of the knee was painfully restricted.\nRadiographs of the left knee revealed a united fracture patella with broken cerclage wire (). The inferio-medial segment of the broken cerclage wire was found to have migrated into the posterior compartment of the knee joint and hooked anteriorly at the base of anterior cruciate ligament.\nThe patient underwent surgery for removal of the patella wires. Fluoroscopic examination before surgery revealed the posterior part of wire had shifted its position with anterior part of it still hooked with anterior cruciate ligament. An arthroscopic examination of the knee was done through the standard anteromedial and anterolateral portal.

The injury was sustained when he fell against the metal pedal of his bicycle. After 3 days of hospitalization and multiple courses of antibiotic, a surgical team was consulted for operative debridement of the wound. Diagnosis and confirmation of necrotizing fasciitis by polymicrobial group A streptococcal organisms was made. The resultant surgical debridement of the right posterior leg over the span of 1 week resulted in an open wound extending from the right popliteal fossa to about 8 cm from his right ankle (). After a period of negative pressure wound therapy, the patient was referred to University of California Davis Medical Center for definitive reconstruction of his posterior right leg wound with exposed Achilles tendon. The patient had a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, currently in remission, and ureteral stone causing hydronephrosis. He had no history of diabetes, alcoholism, or other general medical condition. The patient was a habitual smoker with history of drug abuse. Upon transfer to University of California Davis medical center, he was immediately prepared for free-tissue transfer.\nA line was drawn from anterior superior iliac spine to the lateral border of the patella (). This line roughly corresponds to the intermuscular septum between the rectus femoris and the vastus lateralis muscles. Skin vessels supplying the ALT flap are centered along this line or slightly lateral of it. The midpoint of this line, an area where skin perforators are generally located, was marked. Additional perforators were located within 10 cm proximal and distal to the midpoint perforator. At each location, this conventional naming system of skin perforator clusters provides a guideline for vascular localization.

He complained of fractured maxillary incisors and presented a desire to get them restored in order to have an aesthetic smile. Clinical examination of the patient revealed complicated crown fracture of the upper incisors. An intraoral swelling with a sinus tract was present on the labial gingiva between upper right central and lateral incisor (Figures and ). A radiograph of the maxillary anterior region illustrated horizontal root fracture at the middle third of the upper right central and lateral incisors () but clinically no mobility of the coronal fragment was evident. On the other hand the roots of the upper left central and lateral incisors were intact and endodontic treatment had been done for the upper left central and lateral incisors ().\nAfter explaining the treatment plan to the patient and obtaining his consent, endodontic treatment with the upper right central and lateral incisors was initiated. The working length was correctly determined and canals were cleaned, shaped using K files in a step-back manner to an apical file size #60. The remainder of the canals were shaped to obtain a uniform taper from apex towards coronal. An interappointment calcium hydroxide dressing was given and the patient was recalled after 7 days.\nOn the second visit, when the swelling had resolved, root canals were sectionally obturated with gutta percha cone and AH plus sealer. A gutta percha cone of the same size of the prepared root canal (size #60, with a taper of 2%) was selected and tried into the canal to obtain a snug fit. It was then cut to obtain a section which would be 2-3 mm short of the apical fragment of the root.

While performing the orchiopexy, the surgeon had inadvertently injured the right femoral artery by electrocautery. The artery was repaired, but as he failed to palpate a good distal pulse, the patient was referred to us at a tertiary hospital which is about 300 km away. The patient was transported by road and reported to us about 12 h after the injury. On examination of the referral notes, it was found that a peripheral computed tomography angiography of the lower extremity with aortography was performed immediately after the repair of the femoral artery at the primary institute, which suggested abrupt cutoff of the right femoral artery near the origin of the profunda femoris artery. At presentation, the distal pulses were absent in the right lower limb, and the limb was pale and cold. The patient had a sutured wound over the right upper thigh starting from the pubic bone medially and extending laterally along the skin crease between the thigh and abdomen up to a point lying about 5 cm below the anterior superior iliac spine []. After clinical examination at our institute, Doppler study of the lower limbs was performed to know the extent of the thrombosis, which showed a thrombus extending from the femoral up to the external iliac artery above the inguinal ligament proximally. Immediate reexploration was planned in view of pale and cold peripheries of the affected leg and no distal flow on Doppler. On exploration of the wound, it was found that orchiopexy was not completed by the previous surgeon and the testis was seen lying in the superficial inguinal pouch at the superior flap of the wound.

A computed tomography of the neck with contrast at the time showed two confluent masses in the right axillary and right supraclavicular regions encasing the right subclavian and axillary vein, the internal mammary artery, and narrowing of the lower internal jugular vein. Patient was subsequently diagnosed with primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis. The patient was evaluated by the oncology and radiation oncology services and underwent multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Her course of chemotherapy was complicated by thrombocytopenia and metastatic disease progression. The patient was determined to be a nonsurgical candidate. Gradually, her pain of the right upper extremity worsened, and the patient was started on opioid therapy. Despite titration of her oral medications to extended release morphine 90 mg two times a day, immediate release morphine 30 mg every 2 to 3 hours, methadone 5 mg daily, and gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, her pain control remained suboptimal.

She had been treated elsewhere as septic arthritis of the left knee based on the radiological features of severe bone defect of the medical condyle of the left tibia. There was neither history nor clinical appearance suggestive of septic arthritis of the left knee. Results of investigations did not support the diagnosis of infection of her left knee. There was genu varus deformity of her left knee, and she walked with an antalgic gait, occasionally requiring a walking frame for long-distance walking. She had never been hospitalised before. She was given two trials of oral antibiotics empirically but to no avail. Due to the persistent pain that had not resolved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy and antibiotics, she was referred to our orthopaedic department.\nAt our centre, we found there was muscular weakness in the lower extremities. Movement of the left knee was painful with limited range of movement of 0° to 90°. The skin in the affected knee was normal without signs of infection, vascular abnormalities or oedema. Peripheral pulses in the left lower limb were normal. The varus deformity of left knee was passively correctable. Radiograph of her left knee showed no progressive changes of the bone defect compared to the bone defect ten months previously. () Laboratory studies including haematological tests revealed no evidence of metabolic, neoplastic, immunological or infectious aetiology. She was then scheduled for total knee replacement for her left knee, six months later.\nHowever, while awaiting elective surgery, three months after presenting to our centre, she returned with complaint of right hip pain of three weeks duration. The right lower limb was shorter by two centimetres compared to the left lower limb. There was no history of trauma or infection. Radiograph of the right hip revealed complete osteolysis of the femoral head, though a radiograph three months earlier had shown a normal hip joint.

The patient was performing a one-rep max bench press when he felt a pop in his right upper arm, accompanied by severe pain. There was no history of anabolic steroid use. He was initially treated with ice and a sling by a trainer and presented to the emergency department for further evaluation. Plain films were negative for fracture or dislocation and the patient was neurovascularly intact, so he was discharged home by ER staff in the sling. He presented to the orthopedic clinic the following day with moderate pain in the chest and arm. He denied numbness and paresthesia. On physical examination, there was a large amount of swelling and ecchymoses throughout the right upper arm extending into the pectoralis major muscle belly. Additionally, there was a large bulge in the anterior chest with loss of contour of the axillary fold (). The patient had full active range of motion of the elbow, wrist, and digits. He was sensory intact throughout the right upper extremity with a 2+ radial pulse. An MRI was scheduled to determine the extent of the injury and to aid in surgical planning. The patient was given oxycodone and valium to alleviate the pain and muscle spasms until surgery, which was scheduled after his MRI. The MRI demonstrated avulsion of the pectoralis major tendon from its insertion on the humerus with retraction as well as strain of the anterior deltoid (Figures and ). He was scheduled for surgery in five days. Two days later, the patient returned to our facility with severe worsening pain in the right upper arm. Intracompartmental pressure readings in the anterior compartment of the arm taken about the midpoint of the biceps at the point of maximal swelling were 37, 39, and 42 mmHg with a diastolic blood pressure of 71 mmHg ().

A computed tomography of the neck with contrast at the time showed two confluent masses in the right axillary and right supraclavicular regions encasing the right subclavian and axillary vein, the internal mammary artery, and narrowing of the lower internal jugular vein. Patient was subsequently diagnosed with primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis. The patient was evaluated by the oncology and radiation oncology services and underwent multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Her course of chemotherapy was complicated by thrombocytopenia and metastatic disease progression. The patient was determined to be a nonsurgical candidate. Gradually, her pain of the right upper extremity worsened, and the patient was started on opioid therapy. Despite titration of her oral medications to extended release morphine 90 mg two times a day, immediate release morphine 30 mg every 2 to 3 hours, methadone 5 mg daily, and gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, her pain control remained suboptimal. She was referred to our pain clinic for further management of her intractable pain.\nOn presentation, the patient reported a constant 10/10 pain on the numeric pain rating scale (NRS) of the right proximal humerus, right anterior and posterior shoulder, and right supraclavicular region. The pain was reported as dull, aching, burning, and electric in nature. Her pain was worsened by passive and active range of motion, and the pain at its best was a 7/10 with oral medications.

He had not received treatment because he was asymptomatic. Eight months earlier, he experienced chest discomfort after eating and visited our hospital. His past history is pediatric asthma. The diameter of his middle esophageal diverticulum was 47 mm, and the accumulation of contrast medium was observed in the diverticulum. A gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a diverticulum in the right wall located 30 cm from the incisor row (Fig. ), and the diverticulum mucous membrane was partially covered by adherent white matter that was unstained with iodine (Fig. ), and narrowband imaging which revealed type A. We performed a biopsy, and the pathological findings of the endoscopic biopsy were atypical epithelium and no malignant findings. We confirmed the function of the lower esophageal sphincter, and the esophageal body peristaltic wave was observed to be normal using high-resolution manometry. We decided to perform a thoracoscopic diverticulectomy based on his symptoms and the possibility of malignancy suggested by the atypical epithelium. Surgery was performed with the patient placed in the prone position and four trocars inserted into the right thoracic cavity. A 12-mm trocar was inserted into the fifth intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. Only the left lung was ventilated, and a pneumothorax in the right chest was created using CO2 gas at 6 mm. Twelve-mm trocars were inserted into the seventh and ninth intercostal spaces at the level of the inferior scapular angle. A 5-mm trocar was then inserted into the seventh intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. The thoracoscope was inserted via the 12-mm port in the ninth intercostal space at the level of the inferior scapular angle.

Supplemental MRI showed a heterogeneous tumor of 4 × 6 cm, which was enhancing on the T1 sequences after contrast administration, and a periosteal reaction at the distal part of the tumor (). The cortical destruction and the contrast enhancing areas in the bone by MRI may suggest malignancy. The patient was referred to a national sarcoma center where a thorough medical history revealed that the patient had undergone left sided hemi-thyroidectomy 2 years previously due to a 5 cm follicular adenoma. He also had a malignant melanoma excised 8 years earlier from his left upper arm.\nA whole-body PET-CT confirmed the suspicion of malignant tumor in the proximal part of the left humerus and cortical destruction at the greater tuberosity (). A fat layer separated the tumor from the surrounding soft tissue, indicating that the tumor was only located to the bone. The PET-CT also revealed a small lymph node at the angle of the left mandible, suspected of being malignant. It was impossible to perform a biopsy of the lymph node due to its small size and location. Instead an ultrasound-guided histological biopsy was performed from the tumor in the left humerus, where cortical destruction enabled the needle to pass (). Histology revealed a carcinoma with morphology and immunohistochemical profile indicative of metastasis from the thyroid gland. The cells where characterized by abundant granular cytoplasm due to aberrant accumulation of mitochondria, which is a characteristic of oncocytes () ().\nDue to this, the patient underwent thyroidectomy of the right side and isthmus of the gland, excision of the lymph nodes on the right side of the neck, and excision of the PET-positive lymph node on the left side of the neck.

His previous dental history revealed that he had a history of trauma 2 years back, in which his anterior teeth and right upper and lower central incisors were fractured. He underwent dental treatment for the same that included root canal therapy followed by crown placement on both the teeth. The patient remained asymptomatic for a year when he started noticing a defect in his gum related to his lower front teeth. He again visited the dentist where his scaling was done and was advised to massage his gums with a chlorhexidine gel. The patient had been regularly massaging his gum ever since and did not report back to his previous dentist to seek further treatment.\nHis intraoral examination revealed fair oral hygiene. Upper and lower right central incisors had a porcelain-fused-to-metal crown of which the lower was dislodged from the tooth. A mucosal with alveolar bone fenestration on the labial surface was apparent in relation to lower right mandibular central incisor, and a portion of the root which appeared apex of the root of mandibular right central incisor was visible through the defect []. The fenestration was slightly elongated in shape, measuring approximately 5 mm × 3 mm in diameter. The area was free of pus and calculus, and the surrounding gingiva appeared healthy. There were no periodontal pocket, no mobility, and no communication of fenestration with the gingival sulcus on periodontal probing. A transgingival probing or bone sounding under local anesthetic infiltration gave the impression of probable loss of alveolar bone along the length of the root facially.

She underwent removal of the tibial WasherLoc approximately 10 years later, in the early 2000's ().\nThe patient was positioned supine; standard incision with a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed. A measured resection technique was then performed with an intramedullary guide placed in the femur. The femur was cut in 6 degrees of valgus and 3 degrees of external rotation. A size 4 femoral prosthesis was placed and noted to overhang both medially and laterally on the condyles. At this time, it was decided to downsize the femoral component. The 4 in 1 femoral cutting block was then placed back on the femur and was noted to be in contact with the bone mulch ACL screw. The bone mulch screw was located and identified in the lateral femoral condyle; a curette was used to clear the head of the screw, and it was removed. The proximal tibia was then prepared using an intramedullary guide with 3 degrees of posterior slope. A size 3 tibial component and a 9 mm poly were placed; the knee was noted to be tight in both flexion and extension. An additional 2 mm resection was performed on the proximal tibia. It was noted at this time while trying to trial the prostheses that the lateral femoral condyle was fractured. Conversion to a stemmed femoral component with a cruciate stabilizing prosthesis was attempted. The femoral canal was reamed, and the femoral box cut was made.

She had a history of multiple blood transfusions and sclerotherapy sessions. Her first pregnancy was 2 years prior to admission, in which she had regular supervised antenatal checkups on her first and second trimesters with a normal anomaly scan. Her pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus that was controlled through diet. She had episodes of recurrent malena in this pregnancy. Her third trimester was unsupervised at home and she was admitted to a local private practitioner at the onset of her labour. She underwent caesarean section for meconium-stained liquor. She delivered a grossly normal male baby with jaundice at birth. Details pertaining to the baby are not available, but the baby had received a blood transfusion on the third day of life and died on the seventh day.\nHer present pregnancy was a spontaneous conception. Her first and second trimester antenatal checkups were with a private practitioner in her hometown.

She had a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, secondary severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and permanent atrial fibrillation. As part of the sequence of heart failure therapies, the patient also had a previous implant of an ICD for primary prevention 5 years before.\nDuring hospitalization, the patient developed diverse infectious complications which contributed to a slow resolution of acute heart failure, with the need of many days of inotropic and vasopressor support and subsequent suboptimization of heart failure therapy. As the patient was recognized as having criteria for advanced heart failure, she was referred and transferred to our advanced heart failure center.\nFollowing admission to our hospital, an ECG was performed, showing ventricular paced rhythm with RBBB pattern in V1 through V5 leads and extreme right axis displacement of the mean QRS in the frontal plane clearly indicating an electrical activation from the left ventricle [], which raised suspicion of ICD lead malposition. Chest radiography was performed also showing an abnormal lead path, suggestive of implantation of the lead in the left ventricle []. To confirm our suspicion, our patient then performed a transthoracic echocardiogram, which showed biventricular dilatation with moderate systolic dysfunction, severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and signs of right ventricular pressure overload with plethoric inferior vena cava and abnormal septal motion with systolic “flattening” toward the left ventricle. Peak systolic gradient between the right ventricle and the right atrium was normal, probably underestimated because of right ventricular dysfunction and severe enlargement of the right atrium. However, the implanted ICD appeared to pass through the interatrial septum, with its lead tip in contact with the midsegment of the left ventricular anterolateral wall [-].

Hormone receptor status was not assessed but she was prescribed adjuvant tamoxifen for 5 years.\nAlmost 10 years later, in December 2002, our patient underwent a left mastectomy and axillary clearance for a 23 mm grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma showing vascular invasion and involving 2 axillary lymph nodes. The carcinoma was only focally ER positive and PR negative, but c-erbB2 strongly positive. She received adjuvant chemotherapy [6 cycles FEC] and chest wall radiotherapy, and in view of the albeit weak ER positivity, she was started again on tamoxifen.\nIn August 2004 she complained of back pain. An MRI scan demonstrated multiple bone metastases in the cervical and thoracic spine, and there was some spinal cord compression at T3. A good symptomatic response followed palliative radiotherapy to the upper thoracic spine, and this was followed by 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy in combination with trastuzumab, a change in her hormonal treatment from tamoxifen to letrozole, and a 2-year course of bisphosphonate therapy with zoledronic acid infusions. She continued indefinitely on the three weekly infusions of trastuzumab.\nThe response was maintained for 2 years, but slight nausea and newly abnormal liver function biochemistry led to a CT scan in August 2006. This showed a 9 cm, apparently solitary, lower right liver lobe metastasis in addition to the numerous sclerotic bone metastases.

There were also pus drainage and ulceration in some part of the scar. He claimed that there was a tumoral swelling at the dorsum of his left hand in the second metacarpal area for 12 months. It had been gradually increased in size and led to the restriction of the movement of the index finger. Therefore, he came to an orthopedic surgeon and underwent a tumor excision operation about six months ago. He completely improved after this surgery and did not follow up any further treatment. Four months after the surgery, some painful immobile ulcerated nodules with low discharge appeared on the way of the surgical scar. He works as an electrical technician but there was no obvious history of trauma or significant medical problem. Physical examination showed swollen areas at the dorsum of the left hand and palpable tender immobile nodules on the surgical scar with low discharge. Some nodules showed ulcerated crusted surface ().\nThe hematological and biochemical laboratory tests were normal. The hand radiography was done and reported as normal. Therefore, he underwent an incisional biopsy of the nodules. Microscopic examination reveals an ulcerated epidermis with underlying neutrophilic microabscesses surrounded by granulation tissues consisting of plasma cell, macrophage, and fibroblast infiltration. Sulfur granules were found at the center of these inflammatory reactions as filamentous basophilic radiating fungal-like structures in the dermis (Figures and ).\nRegarding these clinical and histopathological data, the diagnosis of actinomycosis was made. Moreover, we asked the patient to bring us any histopathology report of the tumor excised on his hand about one year before his admission.

Steroid pulse therapy was treated for 4 days, and then prednisolone orally for 10 days. On the second day of admission, a visual evoked potential (VEP) test revealed the absence of right optic nerve activity (P100: not detected, flat wave). After steroid treatment for 2 weeks, light perception was absent.

Two months after ESS, her visual acuity remained zero.\nOptic nerve injury that occurs during ESS usually happens when the operation is performed under general anesthesia. Under local anesthesia, optic nerve injury can be prevented because the patient complains of pain the moment that the lamina papyracea is broken. Optic nerve injury under general anesthesia may occur under the following circumstances; 1) When the surgeon relies on his own experience rather than precise anatomical knowledge; 2) When preoperative CT has not been fully reviewed, or 3) When the operation is conducted without frequently checking the position and direction of the endoscope.

This lesion applies pressure to the left frontal and temporal lobes causing mild edema in both these lobes without invading the brain tissue. This edema in turn applies pressure to the left lateral ventricles (minor shift of the elements of the midline to the right side can be seen on CT) (). Due to the tumor’s wide spread,"}
{"note": "A 39-year-old female was admitted into our clinic with a complaint of a 3-month history of a slowly growing mass along the neck midline. The physical examination revealed a 3 × 1.5 cm immobile mass along the neck midline over the thyrohyoid membrane, accompanied by a 3 × 2 cm palpable nodule in the left thyroid gland. A neck US revealed a calcified heterogenic-hypoechoic solid lesion of 30 × 18 mm at the level of the hyoid bone in the submental area, which was not related to the thyroid gland. A thyroid gland US revealed several hypoechoic nodules, the largest being 38 × 24 mm, with some having micro calcifications in the left lobe of thyroid gland, while the study identified no right lobe lesions. FNAB was performed on both the midline neck mass and the left lobe nodule. The FNAB results were reported as being consistent with papillary thyroidal carcinoma for the mass along the neck midline and as benign cytology for the nodule in the left thyroid lobe. MRI of the neck showed a 30 × 20 mm midline solid soft tissue mass with hyperintense signal after injection with contrast media. The MRI also demonstrated cystic changes in the mass and evidence of invasion into the infrahyoid muscle group (). After considering all of the clinical and radiological data, despite a histopathologic diagnosis of benign cytology for the left lobe nodule, we performed a Sistrunk procedure with total thyroidectomy and central neck exploration due to suspicion of simultaneous de novo development of papillary carcinoma in the TDC and the thyroid gland. Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure.\nDuring the Sistrunk procedure, a solid mass invading the infrahyoid muscle group was encountered, and gross total resection of the tumor was performed. A total thyroidectomy operation was also conducted (). During central neck exploration, samples of the suspected lymph nodes were sent for frozen section pathology, the results of which confirmed the diagnosis of papillary carcinoma metastasis. After completion of the exploration, the central neck was"}

Physical examination revealed a firm mass 2 × 3 cm in diameter in the region of the parotid gland as well as right facial nerve paralysis. The mass was fixed with palpation as was a palpable right cervical lymph node. She had a normal body temperature and normal complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and blood chemistry.\nWe investigated the possibility of other diseases that could cause a swelling in the parotid gland: granulomatous infections such as mycobacterial diseases and autoimmune disorders. The results were negative.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an enlargement of the right parotid gland with evidence of multiple cystic masses involving both the superficial and deep portions of the gland.\nFine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy was used for diagnosis. Cytopathological examination suggested ACC with the finding of large globules of the extracellular matrix, partially surrounded by basaloid tumour cells but lacking characteristic globules.\nA radical parotidectomy and modified radical neck dissection with spinal accessory nerve preservation was planned under general anesthesia. A preauricular incision that curved under the ear lobule was made in extension with the neck dissection incision. A skin subcutaneous flap was raised over the parotid until the distal branches of the facial nerve were seen to exit the gland. The mandibular, buccal, and zygomatic branches were incised and tagged with fine silk sutures for later grafting []. As the main trunk was considered to be encased by the tumour, a mastoidectomy was performed, to identify the main trunk of the facial nerve, increase the length of the proximal nerve stump for grafting, and also to provide adequate surgical margin.[] Once the main trunk was identified, extensive resection was performed to remove the parotid neoplasm. Frozen sections from the facial nerve confirm uninvolved nerve margins. After resection of the parotid neoplasm, modified neck dissection was subsequently added and the donor nerve graft was prepared from the great auricular nerve"}

A thorough history into the mechanism of fall revealed that the patient was a known diabetic on oral hypoglycaemic drugs and following a syncopal attack, he fell on his outstretched right hand with the body weight falling on it, causing it to dislocate posteriorly. And a bystander in trying to prevent the patient from falling held on to his left upper limb, which was pulled into abduction, extension and external rotation producing an anterior dislocation on the left side. A detailed clinical examination showed flattening of deltoid contours on both sides. Humeral head was palpable posteriorly on the right side and anteriorly on the left side. Surprisingly, there were no characteristic deformities with the arms hanging by the side of the body. Attempted range of motion was painful on both sides. Plain radiograph anteroposterior view of both shoulders showed posterior dislocation of right shoulder with a fracture of greater tuberosity and anterior dislocation of left shoulder with a greater tuberosity fracture. Special radiographs including axillary lateral and scapular Y view were taken which confirmed the findings. He was not a known epileptic and did not give any history of a seizure episode in the past. He did not have any history of dislocation in the past. There were no features suggestive of generalized ligamentous laxity.\nA closed reduction was achieved for both shoulders under general anaesthesia, anterior dislocation was reduced easily by Kochers method, and posterior was reduced by giving gentle traction on the arm in flexion and adduction, with a direct pressure to the humeral head from behind, but as the posterior dislocation was unstable, after reduction, it was immobilised by spica in slight flexion and abduction with 20 degrees external rotation, whereas a chest arm bandage was applied for the other side. Post reduction check X-ray showed concentric reduction of both shoulders with minimal displacement of fracture fragments. The spica and bandage were removed"}
{"note": "A 26-year old man accidentally had a cut from a circular saw in the medial, posterior part of the right thigh during work. Due to vascular damage of the femoral vessels he suffered substantial blood loss and when he was brought to the emergency room he was in shock but awake. The damage to the femoral artery and vein was repaired immediately and circulation of the leg and foot was restored within three hours of injury. On examination the day after surgery it was discovered that the patient had loss of sensory and motor function matching the area of the sciatic nerve below the point of injury. On the third postoperative day the area was explored and the sciatic nerve was found to be transected. After trimming of the nerve ends there was a gap of 3–4 cm. The individual tibial and peroneal groups of fascicles could be identified in the wound and by electrical stimulation of the distal nerve end. The sural nerve of the injured leg was harvested and divided into eight segments, which were then used as grafts, 5 segments for the tibial component and 3 segments for the peroneal component (Figure \n). The grafts were applied with extended knee position and fixed with single 9–0 sutures and tissue glue (Tissel®).\nThe leg was immobilized in semi flexion for four weeks. The initial rehabilitation was without complication. Follow-up was conducted at our department, every three months the first year and then every six months. The patient used an orthosis during daytime for support and to hold the foot up and physical therapy to counter contractions. Sensory re-education was performed. He later had some tendency towards plantar flexion contracture, especially in the mornings, which was treated with an orthosis during night.\nThe physical therapy aimed to encourage counter contractions in the leg. Motor function progress was measured according to the British Medical Research Council (MRC) scale showing a continuous improvement of muscle force (Table \n) At final follow up (58 months) he, above the muscle force"}

She had received a lumpectomy of her right breast with an axillary lymph node dissection 34 months before she first visited our institute. The pathology report obtained at the time of surgery documented infiltrating ductal carcinoma, and the resection margins were confirmed to be clear of carcinoma invasion. Three regional lymph nodes out of 16 were found to possess adenocarcinoma cells. Lymphovascular invasion was reported negative. Routine staging workup showed no evidence of distant metastasis, staging her as T2N1M0 based on an American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system at the time of surgery. As a surgical procedure, a catheter draining from the lumpectomy site was placed, which was later removed. She had completed 6 cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluoruracil regimen, and radiotherapy of the whole breast with 50.4 Gray plus a boost of 9 Gray was performed. She denied receiving any other type of surgery. No evidence of recur were observed by thorough imaging studies; regular checkups were done at the out side clinic.\nOn her visit, she complained of a recently noticed palpable lump on her right chest wall. Physical exam revealed an approximately 2 cm sized moveable subcutaneous nodule with rubber consistency located on the middle axillary line at the level of nipple. A small scar was noticed on the skin lying directly superficial to the nodule, which the patient claimed to be the wound site of drain catheter insertion during the lumpectomy she previously received. Ultrasonography of breast and chest wall revealed a well demarcated subcutaneous mass measuring 1.8 cm in length (). No other abnormalities were demonstrated in the remaining breast. A sonographically guided 14-gauge core needle biopsy yielded infiltrating ductal carcinoma.\nA whole body bone scan and whole body positron emission tomography scan failed to demonstrate any suspected metastatic lesion other than the mentioned nodule at the right chest wall.

The patient had a history of previous left knee ACL reconstruction approximately 25 years ago using the Arthrotek bone mulch screw and WasherLoc system []. She underwent removal of the tibial WasherLoc approximately 10 years later, in the early 2000's ().\nThe patient was positioned supine; standard incision with a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed. A measured resection technique was then performed with an intramedullary guide placed in the femur. The femur was cut in 6 degrees of valgus and 3 degrees of external rotation. A size 4 femoral prosthesis was placed and noted to overhang both medially and laterally on the condyles. At this time, it was decided to downsize the femoral component. The 4 in 1 femoral cutting block was then placed back on the femur and was noted to be in contact with the bone mulch ACL screw. The bone mulch screw was located and identified in the lateral femoral condyle; a curette was used to clear the head of the screw, and it was removed. The proximal tibia was then prepared using an intramedullary guide with 3 degrees of posterior slope. A size 3 tibial component and a 9 mm poly were placed; the knee was noted to be tight in both flexion and extension. An additional 2 mm resection was performed on the proximal tibia. It was noted at this time while trying to trial the prostheses that the lateral femoral condyle was fractured. Conversion to a stemmed femoral component with a cruciate stabilizing prosthesis was attempted. The femoral canal was reamed, and the femoral box cut was made. However, during trialing, the medial femoral condyle was now noted to have a fracture as well. An intraoperative consultation with an adult reconstruction trained orthopaedic surgeon was performed. Immediate surgical correction was not possible due to improper implants being presented. The femoral and tibial canals were then re"}

The patient seemed to have cognitive impairment, and did not have accurate memory of the trauma. However, according to the report of a family member, the patient had been medicated for cerebral infarction, hypertension, and osteoporosis, with no problems in ambulation and other activities of daily living before slipping down three months ago. After that, she had been in a bed ridden state and showed gait disturbance. Based on neurological examination, her mental status was alert, but her orientation, memory, calculation and other cerebral functions were generally impaired, whereas her speech was intact. In terms of the cerebellar function, there were no specific findings on both of the upper extremities, and the lower extremities could not be checked due to muscle weakness. Although an accurate evaluation of motor function was challenging during the manual muscle test, the upper extremities were found to be in normal range. For the lower extremities, the flexor and extensor of the hip and knee of both sides were in poor grade, and the dorsiflexor and plantarflexor of both ankle joints were degraded to trace grade level. There was no limitation in passive range of motion. In both lower extremities, the spasticity corresponded to the Modified Ashworth Scale I grade. Although accurate evaluation for sensory function was also difficult, the patient showed a relatively intact result in the pinprick test, but the proprioception and vibration sensation were impaired. Deep tendon reflex was normal for both upper extremities but increased in both lower extremities, and Barbinski's signs and ankle clonus were found on both sides. Results of the functional evaluation showed impossibility of independent ambulation. Although the activities of daily living using the upper extremities were possible, the patient needed considerable assistance in other areas. In terms of urinary"}

The patient gave a history of trauma before some years and gradually lost all her teeth due to periodontal problems. The patient underwent medical treatment for the same in a general hospital. The paralysis was noted both in upper and lower regions of the face and the patient was unable to smile and close her eyes on her left side. The patient was unable to lift her left eyebrow and complained of reduced taste sensation, but was not insisting on the symptoms. The patient had spasms in her facial muscles with synkinesis, which developed gradually [Figures and ] and was not clear of the time period over which it developed. There was an asymmetry of her face when she tried to smile or close her eyes with a maximal effort. The diagnosis was Bell's palsy Grade IV[] on the left side of the patient's face which involved the ipsilateral part of the facial nerve. The patient was not willing for the invasive treatment for the same. The patient was given an option of complete dentures with cheek plumpers,[] which can somewhat improve her facial appearance. The patient readily accepted the treatment plan and primary impressions were made for the upper and lower edentulous arches.\nThe diagnostic casts showed normal arch form without any pathologic conditions. The labial and buccal flanges of the dentures were planned to be enhanced as the circumoral muscles were weak. A simple way of enhancing the labial flanges with wax and later processing with acrylic resin was planned due to time and economic factors. Proper physiologic impressions were made after explaining the treatment plan to the patient with her consent. The occlusal rims were fabricated from the master casts with additional wax on the labial and buccal flanges. The jaw relations were made and try-in verification was done at a later date. W"}
{"note": "A 78 year-old male was diagnosed with central non-small cell lung cancer 12 months earlier. The primary lung cancer was located in the proximal right upper lobar bronchus associated with postobstuctive atelectasis of the right upper lobe. However, at the time of diagnosis, the patient refused all the curative means. He had exhibited cough and increasing blood tinged sputum in the previous 4 months. We performed CT imaging on outpatient clinics, which showed a completely obstructed right upper lobar bronchus by a tumor with postobstructive pneumonia of the right upper lobe. The wall of the right main bronchus and bronchus intermedius was thickened and the lumen of the right main bronchus was almost narrowed by tumor infiltrations. Metastatic lymphadenopathy was observed in the right lower paratracheal and subcarinal area (). Nine days after the CT scan, the patient was hospitalized and underwent bronchoscopy. A bronchoscopic examination demonstrated that orifice of the right main bronchus was nearly completely obstructed by the endoluminal mass and there was diffuse bleeding from the right main bronchus. The patient received urgent external beam radiotherapy to control bleeding from the friable endobronchial tumor and bleeding gradually decreased for several days. However, eleven days after the radiation therapy, a sudden onset of dyspnea developed. Chest radiography showed that the right lung had totally collapsed and bronchoscopic examination revealed complete obstruction of the right main bronchus with diffuse bleeding.\nBronchial artery embolization could not be considered as a treatment option for hemoptysis because bleeding conditions were not because of active arterial bleeding and there was no prominent contrast enhancement of the mass as seen on the CT scan. We decided that bronchial stent insertion in the right main bronchus was necessary to both, re-open the airway and to control the bleeding of tumor through the tamponade effect. After the bronchogram, which was performed to identify the airway on a fluoroscopic image, we decided to sacrifice superior segment of the right lower bronchus to preserve basal segments of the right lower lobe.

The patient was also found to have an acute fracture in the tenth thoracic vertebra, and he subsequently underwent spinal fusion of the eighth to twelfth thoracic vertebrae. Within three hours postoperation, the patient was still lethargic and did not complain of pain; however, his left lower extremity was noted to be swollen and cool to the touch from the thigh down with a mottled skin appearance (). Pedal pulses were completely absent on palpation, and no signal was detected on a portable Doppler device. The initial suspicion was for an arterial embolic event causing limb ischemia as the patient had a history of atrial fibrillation. As a result, a computed tomography arteriography (CTA) of the abdominal aorta with bilateral runoff was done and showed the previously placed stent extending from the left superficial femoral artery to the proximal popliteal artery with absent filling consistent with vascular occlusion (). Due to significant leg swelling, a venous duplex ultrasound was done and revealed extensive acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) ranging from the left common femoral vein down to the popliteal vein with completely absent venous blood flow. The clinical and radiographic findings were consistent with a diagnosis of phlegmasia cerulea dolens (PCD).\nAfter clearance from the neurosurgeon, IV heparin was started approximately 7 hours after the development of symptoms. Due to the extensive DVT and the advanced PAD, the vascular surgery team deemed that the chances of limb salvage are very small and that any procedural intervention will pose a great risk to the patient's life. Thrombolysis was contraindicated due to the recent SAH and spinal surgery. After comprehensive multidisciplinary discussions including a second expert opinion which was sought from a peripheral interventional cardiologist, a delayed decision was reached to attempt a minimally"}

He had not had any problems during the perinatal period, but after his first birthday, his limbs had twisted intermittently. Symptoms occurred on either the right or left side limbs, starting from the leg to the arm, and occasionally occurred in the arm and leg simultaneously, or were only experienced on the arm or leg. The symptoms lasted from hours to days. He reported having frequent symptoms that were more than four times per week, and for almost every instance he reported crying. He was unable to move during the hemiplegic episodes and also had a history of convulsions that had occurred several times before starting elementary school. Without the episodes, his developmental milestones were normal in the childhood.\nAfter he entered an elementary school, hemiplegic events recurred if he was nervous or encountered a new environment although it was not provoked by his crying anymore. Symptoms occurred on alternating sides and occasionally in all four extremities. However, once the symptoms presented on one side, the symptoms did not progress to the other side. His symptoms still lasted hours to days and recurred several times a week. Because of these frequent episodes, he could not complete the elementary school although he did not have mental retardation. However, he had not had growth or cognitive abnormality until he became an adult.\nBefore visiting our outpatient clinic, he reported that the symptoms manifested once a month, and lasted for three days to two weeks. The characteristics of the episodes were similar to the episodes during his elementary school age. When the attacks were not present, he could live normally and did not have cognitive dysfunction.

The patient was seen in the anesthesia clinic preoperatively, where her medical history was taken, and physical examination was performed. The patient had a past medical history of essential hypertension on treatment by valsartan 160 milligrams daily and bisoprolol 5 milligrams daily that were prescribed by her treating physician. The patient had a past anesthetic history of spinal anesthesia for a cesarean section twenty years before the time of presentation. The patient history was otherwise unremarkable. Physical examination was only remarkable for uncontrolled blood pressure of 180/90 mmHg which was attributed to poor compliance with antihypertensive therapy. Her abdominal ultrasound was only significant for cholelithiasis. The patient was advised for better compliance to antihypertensive therapy and another anesthesia clinic visit was scheduled. The patient was seen again in the anesthesia clinic three months later. Her blood pressure at that time was found to be 150/80 mmHg, and the remainder of her examination was normal. Screening echocardiography recommended by the treating physician two months before that visit showed normal ejection fraction (66%) and mild tricuspid regurgitation in an otherwise normal study. Electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed before the anesthesia clinic visit and was normal (). The patient was scheduled for surgery and admitted for the operation on the following day. Preoperatively, she was assessed by the anesthesia team in the hospital on the morning of the operation and her blood pressure was found to be 180/110 mmHg, which was again attributed to poor compliance with medication regimen. As the operation was scheduled on elective basis, it was therefore postponed until a tighter control of blood pressure could be achieved and the patient was discharged. She was seen four weeks later in the anesthesia clinic; there were no new complaints and there was no change in her examination except for her blood pressure, which was controlled, being 140/80 mmHg after proper compliance to her medication regimen.

Dental history revealed patient was edentulous since 2 years and had been experiencing above problems since 1 year.\nSo it was decided to fabricate a complete denture with a customized metal palate design that along with the ongoing treatment from gynecologist would relieve the patient from symptoms because contact sensitivity to denture base materials or to allergens and microbial antigens on the acrylic denture plate plays a greater role in burning sensation in edentulous persons.[]\nThe customized metal palate, apart from fulfilling the patient's needs, was designed in an innovative way with metal loops in specific directions and positions that would enhance interlocking with acrylic portion and also not to interfere with the teeth arrangement of artificial teeth.\nThe primary impression was made with irreversible hydrocolloid. Custom tray was fabricated and secondary impression was made with zinc oxide eugenol. The final cast derived from this impression was duplicated and refractory cast was formed. The refractory cast is used for the fabrication of the customized metal palate.\nA sheet of green spacer wax was adapted on the palatal portion of the cast covering the crest of the ridge and extending 2-3 mm beyond it. Loops of 2-3 mm length made of wax were attached to the peripheral border of the previously adapted palatal spacer wax. It was taken care that all these loops were 2-3 mm short of the sulcus as shown by straight arrow []. These loops would enhance the interlocking of acrylic.

On further history taking, she had been experiencing a chronic back pain for the last 2 years. She described her initial pain to be acute in onset, occurring at the lower back because of prolonged sitting on the floor, after which she had an ongoing chronic low back pain. In her current boarding school training, children were accustomed to be sitting on the floor for many hours to learn the Koran.\nShe could perform her daily activities but distanced herself from any sports. Having developed increasing pain in her back, she requested her father to take her to a general practitioner (GP), which required her to be excused from school activities. Hence, her father became suspicious of her real intention and attributed her complaint of pain to the secondary intention of wanting to be away from school. Her father, who had a strong character, dominated the consultation and tried to convince the physician to the idea that his daughter feigned the back pain as an excuse to be away from school.\nOver the last 24 months, she had visited multiple GP clinics. Her recurrent clinic visits were initially driven by symptoms of low back pain, sciatica, and later, lower limb numbness and weakness. The latter was noticeable 21 months after the first clinic visit. On recalling her history, she revealed four crucial time points at which she sought medical help for symptom progression. Most of the time, she was attended by different physicians during her clinic visits.

She had no past history of urological difficulties until week 26 of pregnancy when she was diagnosed with a spontaneous renal rupture resulting in acute left loin pain and hematuria. She denied any accident or renal problems at that time. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the diagnosis (Fig. a, b), and that the fluid around the ruptured left kidney had spread from the superior margin of the 10th thoracic vertebral body to the inferior margin of the second lumbar vertebral body. The patient was admitted to the hospital for observation. The hematuria resolved the day following admission, and she was discharged 1 week after admission when the loin pain decreased and her hemodynamic status was stabilized.\nAt 34 weeks gestation, she presented at the urology clinic with a growing mass in the left subcostal area. Ultrasound showed right renal hydronephrosis without hydroureter. In addition, a cyst was noted to surround the left kidney, and this was measured as 250 × 170 × 233 mm.

Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was negative for distant metastasis. By then, 2 weeks had passed since she first presented with her complaints. Following discussion between the attending surgeons, the patient, and her family, the decision to proceed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy immediately, was made. Two weeks into her neoadjuvant chemotherapy, she complained that the left breast mass had significantly increased in size from the initial 5 cm to 10 cm in diameter. She also developed a swelling in the left axilla that was clinically consistent with that of an axillary lymph node. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the left axillary lymph node was reported to be a metastatic carcinoma. A decision was made to proceed with left mastectomy and axillary clearance. Histopathology examination of the 14 cm by 12 cm left breast mass was conclusive for high-grade metaplastic breast carcinoma – spindle cell subtype, triple negative receptor status. All 12 excised axillary lymph nodes were positive for metastases. Six weeks following surgery, she underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. She defaulted follow-up soon after completion of chemotherapy and underwent Traditional Chinese Medication instead, despite advice regarding potential spread of the disease, and grave prognosis should that occur.\nFour months later, she presented to a district hospital with complaints of pain over the left chest wall and inability to move her left upper limb. On examination, a large fungating mass with a necrotic patch was seen at her left chest wall, extending into the axilla. The tumor had infiltrated the anterior chest wall and was even seen over the posterior chest wall. The left upper limb was"}

Patient was made NPO with NG decompression in addition to receiving empiric meropenem at the outside facility where a cholecystoduodenal fistula with large gallstone in the duodenal lumen was identified by abdominal CT. Upper GI was performed on hospital day four at the outside facility, which revealed failure of stone progression prompting transfer to our institution for definitive management. On intake exam her vitals were stable within normal limits and she was found to have no abdominal tenderness and no distention. Her laboratory values were without any significant abnormalities.\nGastroenterology attempted endoscopic retrieval of the duodenal gallstone, at which time the stone was noted to be 3.5 cm in diameter and obstructing the lumen of the bulbar duodenum. Endoscopic retrieval attempts resulted in partial fragmentation of the stone but were ultimately unsuccessful. The following day repeat abdominal CT revealed migration of the stone into the proximal jejunum ().\nThe decision to proceed with surgical removal hinged on the concern that further distal transit of the stone may result in it becoming lodged in a bowel loop contained in the patient's incisional hernia or a pelvic loop due to previous pelvic radiation. The abdomen was entered laparoscopically. Multiple areas of adhesions were encountered requiring adhesiolysis and ultimately the insertion of a hand port. The stone-containing small bowel was located and delivered through the hand port after which two stay sutures were placed on the antimesenteric border. An enterotomy was then made through which the gallstone was subsequently delivered (). Closure of the enterotomy was achieved via two transverse layers of suture and the bowel was returned into the abdomen. The cholecystoduodenal fistula was left"}

The patient had a past medical history of seizure due to diffuse astrocytoma, diagnosed 7 years previously. Initially she had undergone craniotomy and total tumor removal at another institution. The pathologic result from the first operation was diffuse astrocytoma, World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and afterwards the patient had not undergone chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Her annual follow-up MRI showed slow changes in most medial corner of the tumor margin in MR fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) image which was not recognized until they were review retrospectively (). She was free of symptom for 7 years until she developed seizure with dysarthria and mild headache. The patient immediately underwent CT scanning which revealed hemorrhage at the right temporal lobe correlating with her tumor site. She was admitted to our hospital a week after the initial onset of the symptoms and brain MRI scan with enhancement, diffusion, spectroscopy, and perfusion were performed to confirm the tumor site and any other changes, such as evidence of malignant transformation. On MRI imaging there was evidence of acute hemorrhage at the previous tumor site with thin rim enhancement of the mass-like lesion with surrounding edema, suggesting possible malignant change to higher grade glioma. Increased regional cerebral blood volume (about >2-2.5) from the peripheral enhancing thin rim of the Lt. perisylvian superior temporal hemorrhagic lesion was also another evidence which suggests recurred tumor with probability of malignant transformation with intratumoral recent hemorrhage ().\nSuspecting the transformation of the hemorrhagic lesion to higher grade glioma, we performed frontotemporal craniotomy and total removal of the tumor. The tumor tissue was dissected and it was soft tissue with an irregular margin from normal brain tissue. The gross total resection of tumor was performed under navigation system.\nAfter tumor removal, the patient recovered without any neurological deficit and is not being treated with chemotherapy or radiation"}
{"note": "The patient was a 61-year-old female who had recurrent lower gingival squamous cell carcinoma in the right side of the mandible (Fig. ). Segmental resection of the mandible including the surrounding soft tissue with a 10-mm safety margin was scheduled.\nSurgical simulation and preparation of the surgical device were performed using a 3D model. First, the right and left mandibular rami of the 3D model were connected by the autopolymer resin to keep the preoperative position between the proximal and distal segments (Fig. a). Based on the findings in a CT image, segmental resection was performed on the 3D model with a safety margin of at least 10 mm from the tumor (Fig. b). Since it was necessary to extensively resect not only the mandibular bone but also the soft tissue surrounding the mandible, it was impossible to provisionally fix the reconstruction plate on the mandible before mandibular resection. Therefore, a surgical device that not only guides the direction of bone cutting but also restores the preoperative condylar head positioning in the temporomandibular fossa was needed. The device was made to fit the lower border of the anterior mandible and the posterior border of the mandibular ramus. The surgical device to guide the direction of mandibular resection had a U-shaped handle so that adaptation of the device would not interfere with the soft tissue to be removed and had holes to be fixed on the mandible with screws (Fig. c). A titanium reconstruction plate was bent so as to be inside at the area of resection in the 3D model.\nSegmental mandibular resection was performed via a submandibular approach. The surgical device was fixed on the mandible with two screws each at the proximal segment and distal segment (Fig. a). The mandibular resection was performed along the proximal and distal edges of the device fixed to the mandible (Fig. b). After the pre-bent titanium reconstruction plate had been fixed on the proximal and distal segments with screws, the screws used to fix the surgical device were removed (F"}

Apart from eczema, he had no other medical issues. On examination he had a very slight restriction of internal rotation in the right hip when compared to the left. However, this was completely pain free. A plain radiograph of the pelvis was performed, which was normal with no evidence of bony injury or Perthes disease (Figure ).\nAn MRI was requested but before this was performed the patient had another episode of right hip pain and a temperature of 38.2.

She indicated that her smile has changed following the surgical operation which applied after the traffic accident in the year 2004. After the healing period she directed her complaints to the plastic surgeon but the doctor persuade her that the problem was related with her teeth only. Therefore the patient appealed to our clinic. The clinical and radiographic examinations revealed that all of the maxillary incisors were vestibulary positioned. The maxillary right canine along the maxillary incisors had oblique fractures involving enamel. The maxillary left lateral incisor had not fractured and was intact. The position of maxillary segment between the right premolar and left canine was approximately 3 mm lower than its ideal position (). Observing that the inferiority of right canine and lateral incisor is higher than the others, there is a probability that the segment not only placed 3 mm below its ideal position but also placed a few degrees deviation off the vertical axis (). The misplacement of the segment is explained to the patient and segmental osteotomy is suggested. The patient rejected the suggestion indicating that she is tired of serial surgical operations, thus the malpractice played a negative effect on her psychology as well.\nA conservative treatment was taken into consideration. The indication was porcelain laminate veneers for the maxillary incisors and right canine, all ceramic crown for maxillary right first premolar because of excessive hard tissue loss and a metal-ceramic fixed partial denture for the anterior mandible due to economic reasons.\nBefore the prosthetic treatment the maxillary right central incisor and first premolar was endodontically treated as they were found to be non vital during the vitality test.

After birth, he developed respiratory distress and was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit where a chest X-ray demonstrated multiple cystic lucencies in the right lung field initially concerning for a CPAM. Prenatal care was limited and it was unknown if the lesion had been previously diagnosed on ultrasound. He required CPAP for respiratory support which was weaned off on day 1 of life. He was discharged home on day 7 of life to follow up with pediatric surgery.\nHe presented for surgical consultation at 3 weeks of life. Examination revealed a well-appearing 3.75 kg infant, with clear breath sounds bilaterally and no evidence of heart failure. His parents reported no further respiratory symptoms. The computed tomography (CT) angiogram was obtained which revealed a cystic lung lesion in the right lower lobe with a large systemic artery originating from the distal thoracic aorta proximal to the origin of the celiac artery (\n). These findings confirmed the diagnosis of a PS. The need for surgery to avoid complications related to the sequestration was discussed with the infant's parents. Due to the large size of the systemic feeding vessel, we elected to perform angiographic embolization preoperatively to reduce the risk of intraoperative bleeding. Ideally, we would have performed resection at 3 months of age, but the procedure was delayed until 7 months due to social circumstances beyond our control. During that time, the infant remained asymptomatic.\nHe was admitted and underwent angiography via right femoral arterial access with interventional radiology.

In March 2010, the patient underwent an open right hemicolectomy for benign multiple colonic polyps and subsequently developed an incisional hernia. In November 2010, he underwent open incisional hernia repair with an onlay Prolene mesh. Subsequent to the mesh repair, he had sharp pain in the epigastric area particularly when bending forward and fullness in his upper abdominal region. He was referred to the outpatient general surgery clinic at a tertiary level hospital for an assessment. On focused abdominal exam, he had a midline laparotomy incision with no acute signs of infection. There was fullness superior to his umbilicus with a palpable subcutaneous mass measuring approximately 6 cm in diameter. Cross sectional imaging revealed an ovoid collection in the anterior abdominal wall, measuring 4.4 × 8 cm on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 3.3 × 5.4 cm on computed tomography (CT). In addition, an abnormal calcification superior to the collection could be appreciated on CT (). These findings were suggestive of a chronic hematoma and scar tissue.

Ultrasonogram also revealed some abnormal lymph nodes in the right level 2 area of neck (). Her mantoux test was 34 mm. Chest X-ray was normal. This patient was referred to the chest physicians and was started on standard quadruple therapy.\nShe was seen recently approximately 12 months post treatment and has responded well to treatment and her neck swelling has disappeared. She is euthyroid. A repeat ultrasound showed complete resolution of the neck mass and lymph nodes.\nAlthough tuberculosis has been reported in many parts of the human body, thyroid involvement is extremely rare and its true incidence is unknown. The rarity of this disease is attributed to various factors including bactericidal property of colloid material and high thyroid blood flow [].\nTuberculosis of the thyroid gland may be primary or occur in association with tuberculous infection of other organs [].

The extent of the cancer involved entire left side of the face, left ear, and scalp. He had visual loss in his left eye and facial disfigurement. He was cared for at home by his mother and grandmother. His father lived and worked in a different city and he had one teenage sibling who was his younger sister. After the initial diagnosis, he underwent radical facial surgery including maxillectomy and postoperative chemo radiotherapy. He was Ryle's tube fed after the surgery due to dysphagia. One year later, he had recurrence of the cancer at the operative site. He had an ulceroproliferative wound involving the left side of the face, eroding the left ear canal. The wound was infected and was covered with slough and maggots. He was referred to the community PC by his primary treating doctors for symptom control and specialist PC. At this point of time, he had disease progression on the treatment and options of disease modifying treatment were very limited.\nHe was seen regularly in the community by a multidisciplinary PC team. During the initial visit the patient had uncontrolled pain and purulent discharge from the left side of the face. He was studying in class 9 and had discontinued his schooling. He was fairly independent with activities of daily living and use to watch television and occasionally, turn pages of a magazine, and see pictures. His mood was depressed and often had crying spells. His grandmother was very loving and supportive and her presence was very comforting to him.

{"note": "In July 2008, a 50 year-old white male was referred to us for evaluation of the decision by his primary care physician to maintain him on life-long anticoagulation, a decision based on the findings of deficiencies of both protein C and protein S. He is in good health and has no known family history of DVT or coagulation abnormalities. In June 2006, he fell from a tree at work, and a fracture of his right femur was redressed by insertion of a titanium rod. One week after surgery, he complained of pain in his right calf. DVT was confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography and he was anticoagulated with heparin and Coumadin and maintained on 9 mg Coumadin and 325 mg aspirin until June 2007 when he began noticing spontaneous bruising and large hematoma appearing without provocation. He requested that his primary care physician re-evaluate the basis for his anticoagulation. Blood drawn while he was taking a therapeutic Coumadin dose was sent to a regional laboratory for a thrombophilia work up. Results of laboratory tests were significant for protein S activity levels 36% [normal range 54-130%] and protein C activity levels 10% [normal range 70-130%]. Protein C and protein S antigen levels were not performed, and the test results were interpreted as a protein C and protein S deficiency. In our laboratory we drew a blood sample while the patient was taking Coumadin and we prepared citrate platelet poor plasma from blood with the results shown in . We report a normal coagulation profile and normal response to the prescribed Coumadin dose, with no evidence of thrombophilia. There was no evidence of elevated fibrinogen levels or abnormal fibrinogen variants. Antithrombin levels were 100% as would be anticipated in a patient on Coumadin for such a long period of time. Protein C and protein S were within range expected for the degree of anticoagulation. He was returned to his primary care physician with recommendation that, although he did not have a protein C or protein S deficiency he should remain on"}

The patient underwent adenotonsillectomy at 6 years of age, and numbness started to affect the left side of his face 3 months after surgery. At that time, he was informed by his physician, who performed the operation, that there were no problems. However, the numbness affecting the left side of his face increased, and shrinkage and weakness of the left side of the face occurred over the next 2 years. In ten years after surgery, his complaints and symptoms increased (Figures and ) but he could not see the doctor for socioeconomic reasons.\nA physical examination at the time of referral to our centre revealed atrophy of cutaneous and subcutaneous fat tissue on the left side of the patient's face, phthisis of the left ocular bulb and corneal atrophy, left zygomatic atrophy, and asymmetry (Figures , , and ). Hemiglossal atrophy and an increased size of fissures of the left side of the tongue were also seen (). Maxillary atrophy displaced the left upper teeth in an upward and backward direction ().\nThe patient had no dermal lesions or involvement of the extremities. There was no family history of PHA. The patient underwent autologous fat injection at 14 and 16 years of age, but the desired result was not sustained and the atrophy continued (). No antibodies were detected in serological tests. Sedimentation and core reactive protein levels were within normal limits, suggesting that the facial disorders were not caused by inflammatory diseases. Computed tomography revealed no apparent neurodegeneration (), eliminating Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) from the differential diagnosis. The computed tomographic images revealed a decrease in left retroorbital fat tissue and atrophy of the ocular bulb (). The left temporal muscle was atrophic compared with the right temporal muscle (). Magnetic resonance angiography was performed to detect possible vascular causes but revealed no vascular abnormalities of the internal and external carotid arteries or of their branches ()."}

He had been treated for meningitis in another hospital and had experienced fever and seizures two weeks before visiting our hospital. The patient had a history of multiple surgeries for cholesteatoma and had been treated for severe otitis media at the age of 2 years, at which point right temporal bone osteolysis was identified. He subsequently suffered from recurrent meningitis and underwent several brain abscess drainage procedures. At ten years of age right temporal bone surgery was performed to rebuild the separation between the middle ear and lateral temporal lobe. At 16 years, he was diagnosed with cholesteatoma, and radical mastoidectomy was performed. Further details of these operations, performed at other hospitals, were not available. We were unable to obtain detailed past medical records regarding treatment (including surgical procedures) of his cholesteatoma, and we could not estimate whether the past intervention of the cholesteatoma was appropriate. When the patient was 17 years old, he visited our department for the first time to undergo assessment for controlling cholesteatoma, recurrent meningitis, and otalgia. First, tympanoplasty was performed to assess the disease and remove residual cholesteatoma from the middle ear; cholesteatoma was diagnosed by histopathological analysis. It was not possible to determine whether the cholesteatoma was a residual congenital cholesteatoma or a secondary cholesteatoma formed as a result of osteolysis of the external auditory canal or middle ear. At that time, we hesitated a more extensive procedure because of his age and limited information about his past surgical interventions. Meningitis and otalgia were subsequently controlled. However, after six months, when he was 18 years old, the patient experienced another episode of meningitis. At that time, he was also suffering from an epidural abscess, which was drained during hospitalization. He attended our department until he was 19 years old, at which point he chose to discontinue the hospital visits.\nWhen the patient presented at our department again at"}

Her past medical history was significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and degenerative lumbar spinal disease. She was a lifelong smoker who was independent in her daily activities. She presented to her local hospital with symptoms of neck pain and stiffness but denied any chest pain. She was hemodynamically stable and underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan. The scan revealed no obvious vertebral fractures but did reveal a focal pseudoaneurysm along the left lateral wall of the aortic arch between the origins of the left common carotid and subclavian arteries (\n). This measured 19 mm in maximum anteroposterior dimension. She was subsequently referred to the vascular surgical team, who agreed to manage her conservatively with yearly CT scans.\nEleven months later, the patient represented to her local hospital with sudden onset of chest pain radiating to her back. Initial observations were unremarkable. A repeat CT of the aorta demonstrated the aneurysm with no significant size increase compared with the previous CT scan. The vascular surgical team felt that an endovascular approach would not be suitable owing to the proximity of the lesion to the head and neck vessels. Transthoracic echocardiogram and coronary angiography were normal.\nThe patient underwent surgery via a median sternotomy. The aortic arch and the head and neck vessels were dissected. The pseudoaneurysm was identified and appeared isolated to the greater curve on the left lateral aspect of the arch (\n). Following full heparinization, cardiopulmonary bypass was established by cannulation of the ascending aorta and the right atrium at a temperature of 35°C. The base of the aneurysm was approximated using several 3/0 prolene pledgeted mattress sutures from the outside, with reduced flow facilitating the closure (\n). A needle was inserted into the excluded part of the aneurysm to ensure there was no persistent flow. The bypass time was 27 minutes. The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable.

{"note": "A male patient aged 37 years visited the local hospital and planned to undergo botulinum toxin injection to relieve spasticity and dystonia of his left upper limb 3 years after subarachnoid hemorrhage. His past medical history revealed the fact that he had been affected by dystonia and spasticity in his left upper limb, especially the hand, secondary to tuberculous meningitis at the age of 3. The patient reported that for decades his left upper limb muscle strength was normal, however, it decreased to fair grade after the subarachnoid hemorrhage with worsening of dystonic and spastic symptom.\nThe degree of spasticity before the treatment was Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) 2 in upper arm flexor muscles. The patient received a total of 200 U of onabotulinum toxin A (Botox): 100 U each into the left biceps brachii muscle and the brachialis muscle to relieve spasticity. Guiding techniques such as the ultrasound or electromyography were not used, but no complications were noted during injection. Electrical stimulation therapy was applied to the treated muscle, and the patient stretched his arm repeatedly to improve the range of motion. He performed exercises of the arm and shoulders at least 3 hours daily at a higher intensity than usual. During the exercise, there was no discomfort, and later, he increased exercise intensity. However, 3 days later, progressive edema and pain occurred in the left upper limb and he was transferred to our hospital the next day. He had no history of trauma except the stretching exercise, with no history of previous cardiovascular or other hemorrhagic diseases. He did not take drugs that affecting blood coagulation tendency. There were no known drug allergies.

He had been immobilized in a brace at the local medical office.\nClinical examination showed marked swelling of the knee joint, with pain at passive mobilization and restricted active motion: 40° of active flexion and an inability to actively extend the knee. Weight-bearing was hardly possible. There was an obvious gap at the level of the insertion of the patellar tendon on the lower pole of the patella. Testing of the MCL compared to the healthy side showed >10 mm widening of the medial joint line with valgus stress in 30° of flexion as well as in full extension. There was no clinical evidence of instability of the other knee ligaments.\nThe X-ray of the injured knee showed a superior migration of the patella compared to its usual position (). An MRI-scan confirmed the clinical suspicion of a complete tear of the MCL next to its proximal insertion on the medial femoral condyle, as well as a complete rupture of the patellar tendon at the level of its insertion on the lower pole of the patella. There were no lesions of the cruciate ligaments and menisci ().\nThe medical history revealed lower back pain due to a herniated disc, which had been treated conservatively. The patient also reported some pain episodes at the level of the left patellar tendon while jogging in the past. No specific treatment was prescribed for these pains.\nOur patient was operated on under epidural anesthesia 5 days after his accident. Clinical examination under anaesthesia confirmed once again the complete instability of the MCL with valgus stress without laxity in the other plains of motion.\nAt first, we approached the patellar tendon through an anterior longitudinal midline incision.

The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (). Biphasic 200 joules defibrillation restored the heart to sinus rhythm and cardiopulmonary function recovered without neurologic sequelae. Two years prior to this event, she experienced chest discomfort followed by aborted sudden cardiac death after heavy exercise for the first time. Initial ECG at the emergency room showed pulseless electrical activity. She was successfully resuscitated after basic life support maneuvers and fully recovered with hypothermic treatment after being admitted to the emergency department. Her family history of structural heart disease, syncope or sudden cardiac death was unremarkable. Several cardiac examinations were performed at that time. Echocardiography demonstrated no structural heart disease with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Cardiac computed tomography revealed anomalous origin of the RCA from the left coronary cusp coursing between the pulmonary artery and the aorta (). Her follow-up ECGs after stabilization showed a sinus rhythm with an inverted T wave and a prolonged QT interval which was suggestive of congenital LQTS (). She was not taking any medications which can prolong the QT interval and laboratory findings did not show electrolyte abnormalities. But this finding was overlooked and anomalous origin of the RCA was provisionally considered as the cause of the aborted cardiac arrest. She underwent surgery to re-implant the anomalous RCA from the left to the right sinus of Valsalva. After receiving surgical correction of anomalous origin of the RCA, she had been doing well before the second event of aborted cardiac death developed. Coronary angiogram with a provocation test using ergonovine was done after the second event, and it revealed no significant abnormalities and the re-implantation site of the RCA ostium was intact.

He presented to the department of psychiatry with his father, who reported that the child had frequently run away from home in the past three to four years; he had started behaving differently and had shown decreased social interest, irritability, and persistent sadness of mood for the past two to three months. The father reported that after the patients' most recent disappearance from home, he had been contacted by police officials of another state one month after the patient had run away; they had informed him that the patient was at a childcare facility and could be picked up from there. The patient described that after he had run away, he would assume the identity of an 18-year-old Mr. S, who was an electrician. During subsequent interviews, patients described an unusual experience where he had found himself to be floating outside his own body while he visualized his own body from a third-person perspective. This incident had occurred during one of his fugue states in another city; he described being inside a hospital room with doctors who were questioning him about his current state. Later, he had felt like someone else had occupied his body and his soul had left his body and floated up to the ceiling and was completely detached from his body; from his visuospatial angle, he had been able to visualize his own body, which had been very clear while the parasomatic body had not been well defined and he could only see its hands, He had tried tirelessly to reach back to his original self but had been unable to do so.

The patient had a surgery for the swelling of distal right leg 18 months ago by general orthopedic surgeon. Review of surgical records revealed that she was operated for a lytic lesion in distal tibia with preliminary diagnosis of benign bone lesion without preoperative biopsy. Curettage of the lesion was performed along with filling of surgical cavity with autologous bone grafts harvested from the right iliac crest. Histopathology revealed benign GCT of distal tibia. Below knee plaster was kept for 4 months postoperatively. Two months after the removal of plaster, she developed pain in the right leg just above the ankle, along with gradually increasing swelling. Two weeks later, she noticed another swelling over the right iliac crest, associated with mild pain and discomfort. The patient was finally referred to our oncologic clinic. The patient was clinically anemic. There was a swelling over the anterolateral aspect of distal part of right leg with painful restricted ankle movements and another swelling over the right iliac region with mild to moderate tenderness on palpation on both sites.\nPlain X-rays showed lytic lesion in distal tibia with ill defined margins without any evidence of pathological fracture. X-ray of right iliac wing showed large soft tissue mass with irregularity of the bone over the outer table of iliac crest []. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of pelvis and distal tibia was done to delineate the extent of tumor and its extension [Figures and ]. Technetium-99 bone scan showed increased uptake around distal tibia and focally in the ipsilateral iliac region only at the graft harvest site and no additional foci in the body (i.e. ruling out metachronous lesions elsewhere).

After a computed tomography (CT) scan the patient was referred to our hospital with the suspicion of a rectal tumor. Complex medical history included a subtotal colectomy with an end ileostomy and a mucous fistula at the descending colon due to Crohn disease at the age of 16 years. In the following years, the patient suffered from repeated ileus episodes and a laparotomy with adhesiolysis was performed in 2007. She never took any medication for her Crohn disease and no further manifestations of activity were observed. Clinical examination showed the patient in reduced general condition; the abdomen was soft and there was no pain during the palpation of the abdominal wall. Laboratory values were in the standard range.\nThe imaging in the CT scan was not conclusive, and therefore we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to confirm the suspicion of tumor and to allow staging. The MRI showed a massive dilatation of the remaining colon and the rectum without detection of a tumor at the anal level (Fig. ). Lower endoscopy failed due to complete anal stenosis and obliteration of the descending colon at the stoma site.\nThe possible therapeutic options were discussed with the patient. She refused a restoration of the intestinal continuity so we decided to perform an abdominoperineal rectum resection. After laparotomy and adhesiolysis the whole sigma and rectum appeared massively dilated (Fig. ). The rectosigmoid was resected until reaching the muscular pelvic floor. The ileostomy was newly created after resecting the approximatively last 5 cm of the ileum because of a prolapse. The anus was dissected carefully intersphincterically and the specimen was removed completely (Fig. ). The perineum was closed tension free.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful.

The ultrasound of the suspected left wrist mass was executed 10 days prior, exhibiting increased echogenicity within the musculature of the left distal wrist at the site of the patient’s reported abnormality. This echogenicity was asymmetric when compared to the right wrist. The image of the left anterior distal forearm on ultrasound is displayed in . There was no evidence of a focal mass or fluid collection according to the ultrasound report. The patient presented complaining of left wrist swelling, with no pain. There was an unremarkable past medical, surgical, or family history significant to the chief complaint. As far as a differential, the questionable echogenicity within the musculature of the left distal forearm could have been related to a mild non-specific myositis. Moreover, there was no evidence of focal mass or fluid collection, so an MRI was considered to rule out a neoplasm.\nThe patient completed the MRI in 10 days, and then followed up in a week to the clinic. The current status of the patient remained unchanged. The MRI of the patient demonstrated a palpable abnormality secondary to a congenital variation consisting of a PL muscle variant due to an accessory muscle belly volar to the flexor tendons. The signal intensity of this muscle appears within normal limits. This finding was confirmed on the retrospective review of the prior ultrasound. The abnormal muscle variant is displayed in the sagittal view T1 MRI in (), it is displayed in the coronal view T1 MRI in (), and it is displayed in the coronal view T2 MRI in ().\nAfter consecutive diagnostic imaging techniques ruled out anything pathologic including neoplasm, the patient was counseled on the plan.

On the third postoperative day (POD), a dirty brown discharge was noticed in a surgical drainage tube placed in the postbladder space, associated with a high fever and severe abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed fluid collection around a small bowel loop in the pelvis and in the upper abdomen (Figure ). Urgent exploration through a midline incision revealed an injury 5 mm long in the small bowel injury at the base of the pelvis. Because of the presence of severe intestinal adhesions from the previous repeated surgeries, it as not possible to perform adequate bowel dissection for enterectomy and anastomosis, thus the intestinal injury was simply closed by a layer to layer suture.\nAfter this second surgery, no fever elevation or discharge was noted, thus oral feeding was started on 11 days after the first surgery (eight days after the second), as abdominal radiography had not shown any evidence of obstruction or ileus. However, during that night, the patient had a sudden elevation in temperature and enteral drainage from the midline incision was seen. Computed tomography (CT) of the pelvis showed fluid collection and our patient was therefore prepared for further surgery. During the operation, adhesive bands between intestinal loops were dissected apart, the perforated bowel was removed, and intestinal continuity was reestablished via an end to end anastomosis. This operation took almost 10 hours, with estimated blood loss of 576 ml leading to marked tissue edema.\nAfter this third operation, our patient's temperature was normal, but her small bowel was seen to be distended on abdominal radiographs.

He also had suffered a sub arachnoid hemorrhage and was managed conservatively as advised by our neurosurgery department.\nAs for the amputated hand, high end prosthesis was advised for the patient but being from very poor background it was far beyond his budget. A man who depends entirely on daily wages and manual labor to feed himself and his family, losing the functionality of one hand was devastating and depressing for him. The main problem that presented before us was not only to stabilize him, but also allow him to get back into the society with gratitude and without having to depend on others for his daily chores and financial needs. Considering all these factors, Krukenberg operation was planned for him. Although this surgery is seldom done and even not recommended by many surgeons but it was currently the best available option for him. He was explained in detail about the procedure and extent of functionality he could attain. Videos and photographs were shown to further elucidate the whole process. Earlier the patient and relative were reluctant for the procedure but they had given the consent for the same.\nThe classical procedure described by Swanson and Swanson was followed with few modifications. A longitudinal incision was made on the flexor surface of the forearm. A similar incision on the dorsal surface slightly toward the ulnar side was made.

He visited a general practitioner each time, and the condition was resolved with analgesic and antibiotics. However, his symptoms got worse and he attended our Oral Surgery Clinic for consultation.\nThe patient is a fit and healthy young man with no relevant medical history and no known history of allergy. Past surgical history revealed that he had underwent bimaxillary orthognathic surgery one and half year earlier in a local hospital. Although the postoperative period was uneventful, the surgical team informed him that there was a dislodged orthodontic appliance in his right cheek that must have occurred during the operation. The team explained to the patient that this accident was realized later on the next day after the surgery when the molar tube from the right maxillary second molar was found missing, and its presence was confirmed high up in the right maxillary-zygomatic buttress area shown in the postoperative X-ray image taken on the next day following the surgery. A series of further postoperative radiographs confirmed its location, lying outside the right maxillary antrum. Due to the pronounced postoperative facial oedema at that time, no attempt was made to remove the appliance. The absence of sign and symptoms during further follow-up sessions confirmed the decision to leave it in-situ with continuous clinical observation.\nOn examination, there was no extraoral swelling noted. The mandible and maxilla seemed firm indicating good healing following previous mandibular saggital split and maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy sites and a stable class I dental occlusion. Intraorally, there was a sinus with slight pus discharge on the upper right buccal sulcus region adjacent to the upper right first premolar. All teeth in that quadrant were firm and vital.

His was a case of multiple traumas due to a car accident that happened 8 month ago. He suffered a neck fracture that made him quadriplegic and was operated 8 month ago []. He had a nasogastric tube inserted and had a past history of discharge of food from the foramen of tracheostomy tube after oral feeding. Eight months after the tracheostomy intubation, massive bleeding was noted from the site of tracheostomy stoma and vital signs of the patient became unstable. His blood pressure was below 80/60 and the peripheral pulse was not palpable. As a result, an urgent surgery was performed on the patient under general anesthesia. The anesthetic agents were administered via the tracheostomy tube. We performed rigid bronchoscopy and observed tracheal stenosis from below the vocal cords. Because of the patient's critical health condition and severe tracheal stenosis, we could not have a clear view of the trachea. The tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) was placed in membranous part of trachea, behind the tracheostomy stoma. During the operation, the bleeding had stopped, which we concluded as the pressure of tracheostomy cuff. The site of tracheostomy stoma was dissected. The operation procedure included division and ligature of the innominate artery and separation of the trachea from the divided artery. The defect of trachea was repaired and reinforced with strap muscle [].\nThen, the tracheostomy tube was reinserted. Due to TEF, a jejunostomy tube was inserted in the patient. After the operation was over, vital signs of the patient were stabilized. The course of neurologic examination was not changed after the operation, but right radial pulse was found to be weaker than left radial pulse. The patient was discharged from hospital after 13 days. Two months later, the patient was again admitted to the hospital for the repair of TEF. Endoscopy was done on the patient. A large foramen in anterior wall of esophagus below the upper esophageal sphincter was shown.\nIn the"}
{"note": "Initially, in late October 2013, a 93-year-old male presented with a six-month history of pain and swelling of the left ear. Clinical examination demonstrated a lesion along the posterior auricular sulcus with exposed cartilage within the depth of the lesion. Extending beyond this lesion was a region of erythema that suggested early involvement. There was no evidence of regional metastatic spread. A previous biopsy confirmed the lesion to be a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The lesion was treated by surgical resection via a partial auriculectomy removing a 3 cm tumour. The deep surgical margin was positive, necessitating adjuvant radiation therapy. This was initially prescribed by the referring radiation oncologist with a hypofractionated regimen of 45 Gy in 15 fractions delivered daily using a single lateral electron field – 15 MeV with bolus. This hypofractionated lower dose regimen was originally pursued due to the advanced age of the patient. After the third fraction, the lesion had regrown to 3 cm, prompting an additional 15 Gy in six fractions as a concomitant boost for a total of 60 Gy in 21 fractions delivered over just 23 days, completed in January 2014. In April 2014, an irregular skin lining was noted within the treatment site, which was confirmed to be disease recurrence after a biopsy. A near-total auriculectomy sparing the lobe was performed, with final pathology showing a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and negative margins. Six months later in October 2014, a new squamous cell carcinoma was noted on the lobule of the remaining pinna, and a third completion auriculectomy was performed. Pathology revealed a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with negative margins. Three months later, in January 2015, a recurrent mass developed at the base of the left auricle extending into the previous treatment site and the external ear canal with an invasion of the parotid gland (Figure ). The gross tumour volume was treated with 50 Gy in five fractions twice a week in 2.5 weeks. A high dose clinical target volume was not added and"}

Symptoms of sciatica had begun 6 months ago and then she visited another hospital and X-ray and MRI of the lumbar spine was performed. These showed slight canal stenosis of the lumbar spine. Although she was treated conservatively with medications, the symptoms worsened and sciatic nerve palsy resulted 3 weeks before visit to our hospital. Physical examination revealed a soft tissue mass of posterior thigh with pain and a drop foot with concomitant sensory loss. The patella tendon reflex was normal but Achilles tendon reflex was negative. The sensory exam and reflexes and manual muscle testing in the left leg were normal. All routine blood tests were normal. She had undergone partial gastrectomy 2 years ago. Resection was complete and TNM stage was T2b, N0, M0. The size of tumor was 8.5 x 8 cm and histological examination revealed the tumor was a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with no regional lymph node metastasis. She didn’t receive adjuvant chemotherapy because of her age and her choice. Current Plain radiographs showed a radiolucent area in the posterior thigh without calcification and no changes in the femur. MRI (Figure ) showed the mass with low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and heterogeneous high intensity on T2-weighted images and homogeneous high intensity on T1- weighted images with gadolinium enhancement was originated from sciatic nerve. We planed the surgical resection because her general condition was good and we confirmed local disease only, no evidence of another site of metastasis by CT. Surgical resection of the sciatic nerve mass was based on the assumption that the diagnosis was soft tissue sarcoma. Segmental resection of the sciatic nerve was performed because of complete paralysis and adequate margin. Intraoperative Macroscopic findings (Figure ) revealed the sciatic nerve was tightly surrounded by the mass and the mass strongly compressed the peripheral muscles. Histological examination (Figure ) showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma which was the same as"}

For several weeks following the operation the patient experienced hypesthesia in the left mandibular region and skin. Thereafter, constant, disturbing spasms of the mimic musculature occurred combined with dyskinesia and deep spasmodic pain attacks located in her lower left lip region. In addition, a distinct cutaneous erythema appeared in the region of the dyskinesia (figure ).\nThe patient reported that pain attacks occurred daily immediately after awakening in the morning, continued during the day without any improvement and subsided only at bedtime.\nThere had been no satisfactory response to various neurological or dental therapy attempts nor to acupuncture. Only therapy with carbamazepine had brought a slight and transient relief of her symptoms.\nThe patient felt herself immensely restricted by her symptoms and was socially and professionally disabled. She had had to retire because of the intolerable pain attacks, and reported having suicidal thoughts from time to time.\nDuring the following years she detected alleviation points in her left hand and behind the left ear with which she was able to stop the convulsions and the pain as long as pressure was applied to the points (figure ).\nThe patient had had no history of movement disorders such as hemifacial spasms nor of allergy, smoking or alcoholism. She had no history of medication except for carbamazepine.\nOn physical examination, no anatomic disorders, infections or tumors were found except for a discrete septum deviation.

Working as a hairstylist when she was 18 or 19, she began to have severe pain in her hands, making her work very difficult. She had carpal tunnel surgery on her right hand which provided temporary relief. Her symptoms slowly returned and she continued to have intense pain and difficulty with her daily activities. Seeking relief from her symptoms, she received treatment from chiropractors and Chinese medicine practitioners with no significant benefit. She also tried yoga and swimming but depending on the yoga movements or swimming strokes, she began to have more pain.\nWhen she was in her early forties, she began to have weakness in the lower half of her body. Her legs would frequently give out on the stairs, causing her to fall. Control of her bladder and bowel function also began to deteriorate. She had an MRI, and based on the results, she was scheduled for emergency surgery to stabilize her cervical spine and relieve spinal cord compression. She was informed that it would be an outpatient surgery and she would be home the same day.\nIn May 2011, Susan had a 6-level cervical spine fusion to stabilize her spine and relieve pressure on her spinal cord. When she woke up, she realized something was wrong. The entire right side of her body was paralyzed. What was supposed to be an outpatient surgery with a return home the same day ended up being an 8-week hospital and rehabilitation stay to learn how to walk again.\nIn August 2012, a second surgery was performed with the goal of pain relief. However, she reported her pain was significantly worse afterwards. She would receive weekly injections for pain relief that she reports would only marginally decrease her pain for about one week. She was also taking high doses of medication for nerve pain relief which she also reports provided marginal benefit. She had areas of heightened sensitivity on her legs where a bed sheet or even"}
{"note": "A 78-year-old asymptomatic woman was referred to our hospital for further examination of multiple cardiac tumors in the left atrium and left ventricle, which had been detected on echocardiography conducted before chemotherapy for the third recurrence of breast cancer.\nThe patient was initially diagnosed with right breast cancer in 2003. She had undergone total mastectomy and lymph node dissection before adjuvant chemotherapy. Histopathological analysis indicated scirrhous carcinoma. The first recurrence of the breast cancer was diagnosed in 2007 due to right axillary adenopathy. She had again undergone operation before receiving chemoradiation, and hormonal therapy was started. The second recurrence was detected in 2013, when computed tomography (CT) was performed during a routine outpatient visit. The CT scan revealed right-sided pleural effusion and a mass shadow in the sternum. After switching to another hormonal medication, the pleural effusion disappeared. The third recurrence was confirmed by skin biopsy of a rash on the postoperative scar. Therefore, the regimen was changed to treat the third recurrence of breast cancer. Adriamycin was selected for the patient, and echocardiography was performed for cardiac screening. There were no signs or symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, platypnea, and systemic embolization until cardiac tumors were accidentally detected on echocardiography. She had never undergone echocardiography previously. She had no family history of cardiac myxoma. Physical examination and laboratory tests showed no spotty skin pigmentation or endocrine hyperfunction. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms showed 4 tumors in the left atrium and left ventricle ( and ). Coronary angiography showed feeding arteries from the left circumflex coronary artery to the tumors and no obstructive coronary lesion. Although we were not confident about the diagnosis, we decided on surgical resection because the mobile tumors located in the left semilunar cusp of the aortic valve and anterior mitral leaflet carried the risk of causing embolism or obstruction. On pathological examination, all 4 tumors were identified as myxomas (), since they showed myxoma cells with a stellate appearance proliferate in a myxoid background in nests and linear syncytia ().

{"note": "A male patient, 62 years old, visited Good Samsun Hospital with a chief complaint of a right inguinal region mass accompanied by pain for the previous 3 months. He had no special history of disease; however, the year before his visit to our hospital, he had undergone hernia surgery due to an indolent fixed mass in the right inguinal region. On physical examination, his vital signs were stable, and a hard, fixed mass, accompanied by oppressive pain, with a size of 1 cm × 1 cm was felt in the right inguinal region. The patient's progress was observed for a month during which time an anti-inflammatory analgesic drug was administered to distinguish the oppressive pain from that which might have been generated by the previous hernia surgery. The biopsy of the spermatic cord showed a metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma (). The image showed a thickening of the right spermatic cord, and infiltration around soft tissues was confirmed by using the scrotal sonography (). In addition, abdominal computed tomography indicated infiltration of the proximal sigmoid colon and rectum, as well as a diffuse peritoneal seeding metastasis (). A tumor accompanied by redness was observed in the rectum during the colonoscopy, and a core needle biopsy was conducted on that tumor. A mucinous adenocarcinoma that was identical to tissue previously taken from the spermatic cord was diagnosed based on the biopsy result (). Positron emission tomography (PET) () confirmed infiltration of the sigmoid colon, rectum, and cecum.\nThis patient received four rounds of FOLFOX (oxaliplatin with fluorouracil and folinic acid) anticancer chemotherapy, and the right spermatic cord mass was smaller on the abdominal computed tomography that that was done 10 weeks after the diagnosis of a spermatic cord tumor. However, the tumor sizes in the sigmoid colon and the rectum had not changed, and the possibility of a new seroperitoneum was checked.

He had stopped smoking 3 years before, had no history of alcoholism, and had never taken illegal drugs.\nVital signs at presentation were stable. The patient was afebrile and not in respiratory distress. Physical examination revealed generalized oedema associated with ascites and hepatomegaly. The jugular veins were not distended, but there was a strong clinical suspicion of a right-sided pleural effusion. An initial chest X-ray confirmed an important right pleural effusion and a 1 cm sized nodule in the right lower lobe (not shown). Results of laboratory tests are shown in . Most strikingly, there was a new onset perturbation of liver markers.\nA contrast enhanced CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and the pelvis was performed. The abdominal CT scan showed a very heterogeneous liver. Except for segments 2 and 3, the whole liver contained multiple ill-defined and partially confluent hypodensities of different size suggesting an advanced neoplastic process (). There was also a doubt of a hypodense lesion inside the inferior vena cava (). The hepatic lesions were associated with a moderate quantity of ascites but no splenomegaly (. The chest study confirmed the presence of a large right-sided pleural effusion and a 1 cm sized nodule in the anterior part of the right lower lung lobe (not shown). On transthoracic echocardiography, a well-defined, immobile oval mass with a smooth surface and a size of 23 mm × 30 mm was noted in the right atrium (). The mass was not adherent to the interatrial septum (). The mass extended to the inferior vena cava where it reached a size of 34 mm × 25 mm, creating a subtotal occlusion with a pressure gradient of 13 mmHg between the inferior vena cava and the right atrium ().

She was referred to Chiba University Hospital for further examination and treatment for the cataract. She had no medical history of the left eye, although detailed medical records were not available because she had grown up in Myanmar and had recently moved to Japan to receive occupational training. She did not have any systemic disease and abnormalities. The laboratory tests for infectious diseases were negative. She stated that she was born at full-term and had no family history of retinal detachment. Her left vision was light perception at our first examination. She had a mature cataract with a slightly shallow anterior chamber and the absence of inflammation and iris neovascularization. The dense cataract prevented a detailed examination of the fundus, but B-mode echogram showed some strands of high signals extending anteriorly from the optic nerve head (). Her right eye was normal with a vision of 20/20. The intraocular pressure was 18 mmHg OD and 18 mmHg OS. The axial length was 23.78 mm in the right eye and 23.46 mm in the left eye.\nShe underwent phacoemulsification and implantation of an intraocular lens in her left eye. The surgery was completed without any complications, and the postoperative course was uneventful with a recovery of the left vision to 20/200. A stalk was observed between the optic nerve and posterior capsule, but the retinal detachment was limited to the retina around the optic nerve. One and a half years after the initial surgery, she noticed a decline of the vision in her left eye, and her visual acuity was 20/400. The area of retinal detachment extended over two quadrants of the inferior retina (). There were no retinal breaks. A macula involved detachment was confirmed by optical coherence tomography.

He was found to have a benign tumor in the parapharyngeal space 6 years ago. The tumor had gradually grown in size and he felt pain around the back of his teeth and had difficulty in swallowing associated with mass pressing symptom; he had the tumor resected 4 months ago. On histopathology exam, the tumor was identified as a schwannoma. The patient had no medical or family history of cancer, including intradermal carcinomas. There were no abnormal findings in his eyegrounds, such as juvenile cataract, and his audiometry results were normal. Computed tomography (CT) showed three masses measuring 16 × 14 mm in the posterior mediastinum, 15 × 13 mm in the left pulmonary hilar area, and 12 × 10 mm in the right pulmonary apex area (Fig. ). The patient had undergone CT exam at another institute 6 years ago prior to the CT scan performed at our institute. Retrospective evaluation of the previous CT scan revealed that the posterior mediastinum tumor was 13 mm in size at that time. Chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that these masses had low intensity on T1-weighted sequences and high intensity on T2-weighted sequences. Cranial high-quality MRI showed no evidence of bilateral vestibular schwannoma. The thoracic surgeons at our institute initially diagnosed multiple mediastinal tumors.\nResection of the right apex area lesion had the associated risk of causing recurrent nerve deficit symptom; hence, removal of the two other tumors was planned initially; the posterior mediastinum tumor by right thoracotomy and the left pulmonary hilar area tumor by left thoracotomy in a single operation. During right thoracotomy, a small pericardial incision was made and they noticed the posterior mediastinal tumor to be at the cardiac chamber; surgery was suspended immediately. Following surgery, the patient underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), which revealed that the mass was a cardiac tumor originating from the posterior wall of the left atrium ("}

She was born with a normal birth weight but large head circumference for which she never had a diagnostic analysis. At the age of five, her body weight was already significantly higher compared to her peers. No specific life events could explain her obesity. Cognitive development was normal and she followed normal education. She underwent treatment for recurrent nasal polyps. Her mother also had a large head size and suffered from morbid obesity as well. She was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and died from a pulmonary embolism after placement of an Adjustable Gastric Band. A maternal aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 50 and the maternal grandmother died from breast cancer at young age. The younger sister of the index patient was overweight and was reported to also have a large head size (Figure ).\nSince childhood, the index patient followed several different coaching programs to change her eating behavior and exercise pattern to induce weight loss. She lost weight several times but was never able to maintain her weight loss. At the time of the intake procedure at the bariatric clinic, her height was 1.69 m (SD −0.2) and weight 164 kg (SD +6.8), resulting in a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 57.6 kg/m2 and a predominant abdominal obesity. Head size was not measured at that time since this is not part of bariatric screening procedures. Biochemical analysis of the blood revealed no abnormalities, and excluded endocrine hormonal disorders such as hypothyroidism. The fasting glucose level was 5.9 mM.\nThe combination of early onset morbid obesity resulted in suspicion of a genetic cause of her obesity. She was offered diagnostic genetic analysis of 52 obesity–associated genes to identify a possible underlying genetic obesity cause.\nThe patient was eligible for bariatric surgery and underwent a sleeve gastrectomy without complications (performed in 2014 using a standardized fashion).

The patient was evaluated for stroke and deferred administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) due to the length of time between onset of symptoms and presentation to the emergency department. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the head and neck was ordered and demonstrated occlusion of the intradural right vertebral artery with a severe stenosis of the intradural left vertebral artery. There was a partially occlusive thrombus extending out of the occluded right vertebral artery into the proximal basilar artery (Figure ). It was decided that the patient be transported to our high volume certified Comprehensive Stroke Center where he could receive more specialized treatment. Before transport, he regained full strength and speech which seemed to be largely dependent on blood pressure.\nUpon arrival to our facility, his only complaint was paresthesia of the right foot and blurred vision as well as exacerbation of symptomology with changes in body position. A cerebral digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) revealed that the intracranial segment of the right vertebral artery was recently occluded and likely related to an underlying severe atherosclerotic stenosis near the dural ring. There was also a markedly severe stenosis of the contralateral intradural left vertebral artery (Figure ). DSA also demonstrated the presence of an unstable, partially occlusive clot at the vertebrobasilar junction and a congenital corkscrew configuration of the mid-basilar artery distal to the clot. Due to the precarious nature of the clot in both stability and location as well as the aberrant configuration of the basilar artery prohibiting thrombectomy options, the decision was made to provide dual antiplatelet therapy and heparin for several days in an effort to resolve the unstable clot and allow for development of more favorable conditions in which stenting of the left vertebral artery lesion could occur.

The patient's medical history is significant for a dual pancreas and kidney transplant 16 years before this emergency department presentation. He received these transplants due to end-stage renal disease caused by type 1 diabetes mellitus. His graft function has been stable since transplant and he no longer requires insulin. He does, however, have retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy complications associated with his Type 1 diabetes diagnosis. The patient has had a colonoscopy for unintended weight loss performed a year before this emergency department visit that revealed no visual abnormalities. Upon physical examination, his vital signs were found to be stable and there were no signs of infection. He did have suprapubic tenderness.\nThe serum creatinine was 114 μmol/L with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 60 when this patient presented to the emergency department. No abnormalities were noted in the rest of the patient's blood work. The patient proceeded to undergo flexible cystoscopy to identify the source of the hematuria. A lesion that was highly suspicious for urothelial carcinoma was identified at the ureteral orifice (). It did appear that the lesion was coming from either the transplant ureter or transplant junction. The rest of the procedure was unremarkable apart from a false passage in the urethra likely from a past catheter insertion. A follow-up CT scan showed no hydronephrosis or urothelial thickening in the transplanted kidney. No mass lesion in the bladder could be identified, however, there was some mild thickening in the dome of the bladder, which was suspected to be inflammatory changes due to pancreatic duct dilatation.\nGiven the findings on cystoscopy, a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was recommended for the patient.

The patient had no past history of any disease, nor diagnosed of any chronic illnesses. The computed tomography (CT) scan for abdomen was done and showed large retroperitoneal mass of heterogeneous density, with heterogeneous contrast enhancement posterior to the liver (Fig. ). The mass measured 11 × 11 × 12 cm displacing the right kidney, and the right lobe of the liver and IVC anteriorly. There was focal invasion of the liver measuring 3.6 × 6.4 cm at Segment 7. The right adrenal gland was not clearly visible. The patient underwent an US-guided core biopsy of the mass that showed malignant cells consistent with both adrenocortical carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma; however, the former diagnosis was favored based on the clinical picture. The patient went for a right hepatectomy with right adrenalectomy, cholecystectomy and excision of associated lymph nodes. The lesion and the excised structures were sent for histopathology that showed a right liver lobe mass attached to it measuring 17 × 10 × 7 cm, and the cut section of the mass showed nodular surface with multiple areas of necrosis. Slicing of the liver showed a gray white mass measuring 5 × 5 × 3 cm, which is adherent to the mass and the remaining liver parenchyma appear unremarkable. The microscopic examination of the mass revealed a moderately differentiated HCC measuring 5 cm in diameter, confined to the liver, <5 cm from resection margins and no lymph-vascular invasion (Fig. ), and a separate adrenocortical neoplasm measuring 17 cm in diameter, multiple foci of necrosis, no capsular or lymph-vascular invasion and resection margins were not involved by the tumor (Fig. ). Excised lymph nodes included a single right portal vein lymph node, a gallbladder lymph node and seven para aortic lymph nodes. All lymph nodes were negative for metastasis.

Because of the death of her husband, she did not seek immediate medical attention. She continued to have swelling and increased pain in the right breast. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in January 2016 showed a large fluid collection surrounding the intact right silicone implant as shown in Figure . The case was managed by surgical drainage of fluid collection and capsulectomy. In February 2016, she underwent bilateral prosthesis explantation and bilateral capsulectomy. The pathology demonstrated a 4-cm moderately differentiated invasive SCC. It extended into the muscle, and in situ tumor was noted to extend to the peripheral margin. There was no perineural or lymphovascular invasion. Pathology of the left breast capsule showed chronic inflammation. Computed tomography (CT) of chest, abdomen and pelvis on February 2016 revealed absence of metastatic disease. The patient underwent re-excision of the remaining chest wall mass in March 2016. Pathology showed well differentiated SCC with negative margins. Chest wall fluid was negative for malignant cells. On slide review, it was noted that there was squamous epithelialization of the implant capsule with benign squamous epithelium on both sides. This indicated that the tumor is likely SCC of the implant capsule rather than primary SCC of the breast. Estrogen and progesterone receptor markers were negative as well.

Her electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 140 beats per minute. Cardiac auscultation revealed a continuous murmur at the left sternal border. She spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm with complete resolution of her chest pain. Her troponin I level was 17 ng/ml. EKG-gated multidetector cardiac computed tomographic angiography revealed the presence of a large anomalous left main coronary arising from the main pulmonary artery (). The left anterior descending artery, diagonal branch, and left circumflex arteries arising from the left main were ectatic vessels with extensive collateralization with a large ectatic right coronary artery arising from the right aortic coronary sinus (). She remained asymptomatic, and her troponins normalized. Her atrial fibrillation was attributed to iatrogenic hyperthyroidism resulting from an excess in recommended doses for thyroid replacement therapy. The thyroid stimulating hormone level was noted to be low and reported at 0.05 mU/L.\nA 2D echocardiogram revealed normal biventricular size and function with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. Ventricular wall thickness was calculated to be normal in addition to normal left ventricular diastolic function and filling pressures. There were no advanced valvular abnormalities, and a mild degree of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation was present. There was evidence of markedly increased color Doppler signaling within the interventricular septum suggestive of high blood flow through septal collaterals (Figures and ). Coronary angiography showed evidence of retrograde blood flow in the left coronary system into the pulmonary trunk through collateral supply from the systemic side, secondary to relatively low right-sided pressures, and vascular resistance causing coronary steal (). Our patient was offered surgery for reimplantation of her left main into the aorta but she refused.

He visited a general practitioner each time, and the condition was resolved with analgesic and antibiotics. However, his symptoms got worse and he attended our Oral Surgery Clinic for consultation.\nThe patient is a fit and healthy young man with no relevant medical history and no known history of allergy. Past surgical history revealed that he had underwent bimaxillary orthognathic surgery one and half year earlier in a local hospital. Although the postoperative period was uneventful, the surgical team informed him that there was a dislodged orthodontic appliance in his right cheek that must have occurred during the operation. The team explained to the patient that this accident was realized later on the next day after the surgery when the molar tube from the right maxillary second molar was found missing, and its presence was confirmed high up in the right maxillary-zygomatic buttress area shown in the postoperative X-ray image taken on the next day following the surgery. A series of further postoperative radiographs confirmed its location, lying outside the right maxillary antrum. Due to the pronounced postoperative facial oedema at that time, no attempt was made to remove the appliance. The absence of sign and symptoms during further follow-up sessions confirmed the decision to leave it in-situ with continuous clinical observation.\nOn examination, there was no extraoral swelling noted. The mandible and maxilla seemed firm indicating good healing following previous mandibular saggital split and maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy sites and a stable class I dental occlusion. Intraorally, there was a sinus with slight pus discharge on the upper right buccal sulcus region adjacent to the upper right first premolar. All teeth in that quadrant were firm and vital.

Computed tomography (CT) of chest, abdomen and pelvis on February 2016 revealed absence of metastatic disease. The patient underwent re-excision of the remaining chest wall mass in March 2016. Pathology showed well differentiated SCC with negative margins. Chest wall fluid was negative for malignant cells. On slide review, it was noted that there was squamous epithelialization of the implant capsule with benign squamous epithelium on both sides. This indicated that the tumor is likely SCC of the implant capsule rather than primary SCC of the breast. Estrogen and progesterone receptor markers were negative as well. Afterwards, she received external beam radiation. She was treated with radiation while supine with free breathing. Four tangent beams were used to target the right breast with 50 Gray in 25 fractions, followed by a 10 Gray boost to the tumor bed delivered in five fractions. Radiation was delivered using opposed tangents completed in May 2016. No adjuvant chemotherapy was offered due to the rare histology and paucity of data. She followed up in clinic in June 2016 without complications or clinical recurrence.\nFollow-"}
{"note": "Patient No. 4 was a 69 year old male with a history of laryngeal cancer treated with radiation therapy several years prior to presentation. He required a tracheostomy at the time of his cancer diagnosis but was subsequently decannulated after therapy. His past medical was significant for coronary artery disease requiring stenting, hypertension and uncontrolled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. He developed right angle torsion and subluxation of trachea at the site of his tracheostomy site that was not amenable to endoscopic resection. He underwent cervicothoracic tracheal resection involving the cricoid and 3 tracheal rings, with primary anastomosis. On POD#3 he developed an anastomotic leak. He was taken to the operating room with the intent to place a tracheostomy through the dehiscent trachea but the anastomosis was noted to abut the innominate artery. Therefore, the tracheal dehiscence was primarily repaired and covered with sternohyoid muscle advancement and he was left intubated with the cuff past the anastomosis. A repeat bronchoscopy on POD#6 revealed intact anastomotic site but he failed extubation trial due to development of supraglottic edema from prolonged intubation and inability to clear secretions and a tracheostomy was performed. The tracheostomy incision was made vertically and encompassed the airway anastomotic site and a stomaplasty was performed to protect the innominate artery and to support the tracheal anastomosis. He subsequently underwent one endoscopic treatment 4 months after airway resection and was decannulated successfully. The patient continues to do well with mild grade 1 stenosis 5.5 years later.\nThere were two patients who could not be decannulated (). Patient 5 had somewhat poorly controlled COPD and a history of tracheal stenting, a procedure that predisposes patients to re-stenosis at the level of the stent []. He was noted to aspirate after resection. Therefore, a tracheostomy was placed for pulmonary toilet, and the anastomosis eventually restenosed completely. He prioritized eating over speaking and no further intervention was performed. Patient 7 was a 72 years old male who developed airway stenosis after an emergent slash tracheostomy using a vertical incision. Advanced"}

The patient was referred to specialist pulmonologist. Thorax CT scan revealed the presence of common pleural effusion on the right side of the patient and changes in the lung fields adjacent to the effusion revealed the presence of passive atelectasis. The presence of collapse and consolidation was revealed in the right lateral segment lung. Thoracic surgery consultation was requested for the patient because of the right pleural effusion. Thoracentesis was performed to the patient by the thoracic surgeon. Cytological examination of the material was reported to be compatible with malignant epithelial tumor. However, distinction of mesothelioma and carcinomatous adenocarcinoma could not be made as a result of cytopathology. He had no known previous exposure to asbestos. In abdominal examination, an abdominal mass was palpated in the right upper quadrant. Abdominal CT was also performed to the patient because of prolonged abdominal pain. In abdominal CT imaging, suspected invasion of omentum has been found in hepatic flexure and right transvers colon (). In addition, suspected infiltration and signs of compression of these colonic segments were determined. Laparotomy was scheduled for the intraabdominal mass. Mass of the omentum adherent to the hepatic flexure was found in the operation. After dissection of adhesions, the patient underwent total omentectomy. There was no other pathology in the abdomen. After recovery, the patient was discharged. Histopathology revealed malignant mesothelioma (). Patient was referred to medical oncology after the period of recovery. Chemotherapy was administered to the patient by the medical oncology specialist. Control abdominal CT was performed after six cycles of chemotherapy. Two cystic lesions were detected in CT. One of them was in size of 18 × 12 cm and located inferior of the right lobe of the liver and the other one was in size of 10 × 8 cm and located in right inferior quadrant. Percutaneous drainage was performed for both cysts. The patient was hospitalized until the cysts completely"}

She had another episode of respiratory distress and needed re-intubation, was ventilated and shifted to our hospital.\nOn admission she had an episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding which was treated endoscopically. She got infected with acinotobacter in the sputum, had bilateral pleural effusion and was unweanable from the ventilator. Considering the status of the patient a decision was taken to do the PDT electively. This was expected to facilitate the weaning from the ventilator or as a therapeutic measure considering the uncertainty of duration of the ventilator support.\nHer past history of thyroidectomy was considered in expecting an altered anatomy and difficulty in identifying the landmarks during PDT. The patient was positioned for PDT and prepared and draped. On identification of landmarks with palpation, a pulse was felt which is unusual at the midline of the trachea at the level of the third and fourth tracheal rings. The pulse was rhythmic with the monitor which confirmed the presence of an artery. The artery was traced superiorly and inferiorly and it was seen that it became lateral to the trachea on the right side.\nThe confirmation of this distortion was done by ultrasound guidance (sonosite M turbo - USA) with a high-frequency linear probe. The sonoanotomy revealed that the right common carotid artery after emerging in the neck ascended in the neck very close to the trachea and formed a loop anterior to the trachea at the level of the third and fourth rings and ascended laterally further before dividing into the external and internal carotid arteries []. There were no other abnormalities seen in the vasculature either on the right side or left side. The procedure was abandoned citing the"}

Due to hemodynamic instability, a distal femoral traction pin with 25 pounds of weight was placed in his right femur on the date of admission as a temporary stabilization of his fracture. This smooth traction pin was placed without difficulty using sterile technique and was placed from medial to lateral at the level of the adductor tubercle. The pin sites were then covered with a sterile dressing. Radiographs of his fracture are shown in .\nThe patient's overall condition worsened over the ensuing three days, with development of high fevers, increasing leukocytosis, and continued cardiopulmonary lability. He remained intubated throughout his hospitalization. Due to significantly increased swelling and erythema about the right thigh and hip region, a plain radiograph as well as computed tomography scan was ordered to evaluate for abscess or hematoma formation. Representative images from the scan are shown in . Mild serous drainage was seen about the traction pin sites, but no purulence was noted. The edema and erythema in the region of the knee was significant as well and was slightly more than the proximal thigh.\nDue to the findings of a significant amount of soft tissue gas in his thigh extending to the groin and caudal abdominal wall, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for evaluation and debridement. Upon incision into the thigh, malodorous gas was released, and it was discovered that all of the distal muscle and fascia were necrotic; due to these findings, the decision was made to undergo a proximal open guillotine transfemoral amputation through his fracture site. He also underwent debridement of his lower abdominal wall at this time, with removal of all necrotic tissues. Intraoperative deep tissue specimens were obtained at this time and identified Clostridium perfringens as the culprit. Unfortunately, the"}

She underwent a decompressive craniectomy, surgical neck clipping of ruptured aneurysm and hematoma removal. The patient was treated in the intensive care unit for three weeks. The patient had no prior operative history of tracheostomy, and a cranioplasty was performed. Following the completion of intensive care, the patient was moved to a general ward, and transferred to the department of rehabilitation medicine. At the time of the transfer, the patient was alert and conscious with motor power in the right upper and lower extremities that presented at a grade one on examination. To independently turn-over in bed was possible, but sitting-up required moderate assistance. The patient showed difficulty in maintaining balance while seated and generally required moderate assistance in daily activities. The patient was on Levin tube feeding, and treatment for dysphagia was carried out. The patient was transferred to our department of rehabilitation medicine at ten weeks after the onset of a hemorrhagic stroke. On admission to our hospital, the patient presented with persistent dysphagia, and was still receiving Levin tube feeding. Cervical pain with severity of grade four to five according to visual analogue scale was rated by the patient. The exact onset of diabetes mellitus was uncertain but HbA1c was 5.5% on laboratory examination, and the patient had no family history of diabetes mellitus. The patient was on insulin therapy, but the medication regimen was modified to the administration of Metformin Hydrochloride 500 mg two times a day owing to adequate control of blood glucose level, and afterward, the patient had a favorable blood glucose level.

Patient also had history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Colour Doppler study revealed monophasic flow in the upper limb arteries suggestive of proximal occlusion. Computed tomographic (CT) angiogram showed complete occlusion of the left axillary artery (Figures and ) by sharp edge of the fractured humerus and distal filling of brachial artery through collaterals. Although patient had absent pulsations in the upper limb, capillary refilling was there. Urgent surgical intervention was done in the form of fixation of fracture followed by repair of the axillary artery. Patient was operated under supraclavicular block; orthopedic team first did the open reduction and fixation of the neck of the humerus through a longitudinal incision over the anterolateral aspect of left shoulder. After fixation of fracture, vascular surgery team did the exploration of axillary artery. Axillary artery was explored in the left axilla through a separate incision other than that used for fixation of fracture. Longitudinal incision midway between anterior and posterior axillary folds was given and extended on to the medial aspect of the proximal arm. The axillary artery was found contused for a segment of approximately 8 cm; fortunately, there was no associated nerve injury and the basilic vein was also intact allowing us to use the basilic vein for repair of the axillary artery. Contused segment of the axillary artery was excised after taking proximal and distal control and after heparinization (1 mg/kg). Basilic vein of appropriate length was harvested through the same incision and axillary artery was repaired using reversed basilic vein graft in an end to end fashion using 6-0 polypropylene sutures (). Postprocedure pulsations were present in the left upper limb. Fasciotomy was not done as there was no evidence of compartment syndrome and the limb was not edematous.

Two months after the surgical intervention she presented to another hospital with syncope. On presentation, it was described that this obese patient was bradycardic with a heart rate of 40 beats per minute with stable blood pressure readings. No jugular venous distention was noted and occasional cannon A waves were noted. Examination of the lungs revealed adequate aeration in all fields with no crackles or wheezing. Point of maximum impulse was not displaced. Regular heart sounds with variable intensity were noted with no atrial or ventricular gallops but an early systolic murmur grade II/VI was described noted at the left sternal border. Due to the symptomatic bradycardia a dual chamber pacemaker was recommended and placed without complications. The patient was subsequently discharged home 24 hours after the pacemaker implantation. Four months post pacemaker implantation she was seen in follow-up and she doing fine and reported no complaints. An echocardiogram was obtained and it was reported that normal left ventricular systolic function as well as prosthetic aortic valve function were noted, with no other abnormalities.\nThe patient then relocated and was seen a year later for the first time at our institution. An echocardiogram obtained at the time of her initial visit, while still asymptomatic, showed normal left ventricular chamber dimensions, systolic function, and bioprosthetic valve function. In addition, a pacer wire that was correctly positioned in the right ventricular apex was also seen. However, an abnormal color flow signal arising from the interventricular septum with a predominant flow away from the transducer into the left ventricular cavity was noted. Continuous and pulse wave Doppler interrogation demonstrated a continuous flow with a predominant diastolic component, as shown in Figures , and , all these findings consistent with coronary arterial flow.

Her surgical history was significant for multiple celiotomies for retrievals of purposefully ingested foreign bodies. During evaluation, she also admitted to swallowing an ink pen 3 weeks prior to swallowing the bleach for which she did not seek medical evaluation. She reported no food intolerance or changes in bowel function secondary to swallowing these objects. She presented with mild abdominal pain and cramping, and her vital signs and laboratory investigations were all within normal limits. Her abdominal exam was notable for mild tenderness to palpation diffusely. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen () showed a linear foreign body in the distal gastric antrum penetrating the inferior wall and extending into the adjacent peritoneal fat. No free air or free fluid was appreciated. Initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was significant for mild erythema and edema to the esophageal and duodenal mucosa as a result of the caustic ingestion, and the pen was found to be deeply perforating the stomach antral wall with no associated ulcer or edema (). The depth at which the foreign body was lodged was uncertain, so there was concern for organ involvement outside of the gastric wall. Repeat EGD was done to assess for manifestations of esophageal, gastric or duodenal injuries from her caustic ingestion, and it revealed normal gastric mucosa (). A joint case was planned with the gastroenterology service for endoscopic foreign body retrieval, possible laparoscopic retrieval and gastric repair and possible open retrieval and gastric repair. The patient was taken to the operating room for the third EGD, which revealed spontaneous migration of the foreign body from the perforation site into the lumen of the gastric body ().

Past surgical history revealed that he had underwent bimaxillary orthognathic surgery one and half year earlier in a local hospital. Although the postoperative period was uneventful, the surgical team informed him that there was a dislodged orthodontic appliance in his right cheek that must have occurred during the operation. The team explained to the patient that this accident was realized later on the next day after the surgery when the molar tube from the right maxillary second molar was found missing, and its presence was confirmed high up in the right maxillary-zygomatic buttress area shown in the postoperative X-ray image taken on the next day following the surgery. A series of further postoperative radiographs confirmed its location, lying outside the right maxillary antrum. Due to the pronounced postoperative facial oedema at that time, no attempt was made to remove the appliance. The absence of sign and symptoms during further follow-up sessions confirmed the decision to leave it in-situ with continuous clinical observation.\nOn examination, there was no extraoral swelling noted. The mandible and maxilla seemed firm indicating good healing following previous mandibular saggital split and maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy sites and a stable class I dental occlusion. Intraorally, there was a sinus with slight pus discharge on the upper right buccal sulcus region adjacent to the upper right first premolar. All teeth in that quadrant were firm and vital.

A diagnosis of echinococcosis was made, based on the radiologic findings of multiple cerebral hydatid cysts and a sizable cyst of the heart (\n). The hydatid cyst of the heart was treated first with a thoracotomy, and after a month, he underwent three consecutive surgical operations for the removal of the six cerebral cysts. The patient was on albendazole treatment throughout his hospitalization, and this led to the shrinkage and finally to the disappearance of two other cerebral cysts.\nDuring the first surgical procedure, two frontal hydatid cysts were completely removed via a right frontal craniotomy and another cyst of the occipital lobe was removed via a separate right occipital craniotomy (\n). The patient initially had an uneventful postoperative recovery but 2 weeks later, while the second operation was being planned, he presented with generalized seizures (with loss of consciousness and urinary incontinence). Emergent cerebral CT scan revealed a marked expansion of the left occipital lobe cyst, cerebral edema, and midline shift (\n). A possible explanation of this event is that the removal of the contralateral (right occipital) cyst disturbed the pressure balance between these two lesions and allowed the expansion of the left occipital cyst toward the right side. The patient was emergently operated on and a left occipital craniotomy was performed for the complete removal of the left occipital cyst. There were no postoperative events, and 10 days later the third procedure was performed. A right cerebellar hemisphere cyst was removed via a right suboccipital craniectomy, and a left frontal lobe cyst was removed via a left frontal craniotomy (\n).\nThe patient's focal neurologic signs eventually disappeared, with the exception of a slight unilateral hemianopsia.

She was assured that she would be able to walk freely after the surgery. No mention was made about the existing disease in the hip joints and about the need to operate both the hips. One month into the post-operative period after TKR the patient was totally unable to walk and was reduced to a wheel chair existence. Prior to surgery she was able to walk and do her day to day activities with pain. Even this was not possible after the surgery. When the patient went back to the surgeon seeking remedy, she was told that she needs to undergo bilateral hip replacement in order to walk again. When asked why this was not told to her earlier there was no response. When patient expressed her unwillingness for the surgery due to the previous bad experience and also due to extreme financial crunch to muster money for another twin replacement surgery. She was told to return back once she would not arrange money and until such time continue taking the pain killer.

We obtained a safe margin of depth without parotid gland injury even though the tumor bed was close to the parotid gland fascia (). However, we could not completely rule out micro-injuries to the parotid gland fascia although we reserved parotid gland fascia. After wide excision, the skin defect was covered with a 5×6 cm full thickness skin graft from the left inguinal area. The usual compression dressing with a tie-over suture was applied to maintain the skin graft.\nOn the fifth postoperative day, we discovered exudate from the base of the skin graft through the slit incision site (). The dressing materials were wet and the discharge from the operative site increased during meals. The amount of discharge was approximately 50 mL, and its amylase level was 200,000 unit/L. Accordingly, we confirmed the exudate was salivary discharge and he was diagnosed with a sialo-cutaneous fistula.\nWe decided to use botulinum toxin type A injection because of concern for graft failure due to increased sialorrhea that was not controlled by conventional compression dressings. Using a tuberculin syringe, we administered a transcutaneous injection of 25 IU of the toxin at a point 0.5 cm above the site of the fistula at the surgical incision line and administered another 25 IU injection 0.5 cm anterior from that point.

On that visit her anterior chamber was flat. (The iris and her intraocular lens had been pushed forward against the back of the cornea. This was an indication that the gas bubble had significantly expanded or she had been positioning improperly, with the bubble pushing up against the front of the eye rather than back toward the macular hole.) The pressure in the eye was markedly elevated to 88 (normal being up to 21). The ophthalmologist lowered the pressure to the normal range by withdrawing gas from the vitreous cavity. Later that day the patient developed acute mental status changes and again presented to the ED. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated intracranial air in addition to the gas bubble in the"}

They were embarrassed and had been not treated well by others in the village, thought it to be a bad omen, and came to remove it. There were no other specific problems due to the extra mouth. The patient was brushing that accessory mouth.\nOn examination there were two oral cavities, one normal and other accessory.\nOn extra oral examination of the normal oral cavity, the upper and lower lips were normal. The maxilla was normal. The mandible was asymmetrical due to the bony prominence.\nOn intra oral examination the buccal and labial vestibules of the maxilla were normal. In mandible, the buccal vestibule was normal, but the depth of the labial vestibule was obliterated due to the prominent presence of the accessory oral cavity. The maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth were in normal occlusion, but the mandibular anterior teeth were present at the right side were inclined lingually, but in the left side lower anterior teeth were normally placed.\nThe position was elevated at the right side due to the presence of the cystic lesion of the floor of the mouth, which extends from the midline to right retromolar region. But there was no disturbance in normal swallowing. The tongue movement was normal. Speech was normal.\nOn extra oral examination, the accessory oral cavity was situated below the lower lip of the normal oral cavity on the right symphysis region. There were small upper and lower lips fused at the angle. The right angle was situated 1 cm below the right angle of the normal oral cavity and the left angle was crossing the normal midline extending ½ cm on the left symphysis region. There was skin present in between the lower lip of the normal oral cavity and the accessory upper lip.\nOn intra oral examination in the center of the accessory oral cavity there was a bony prominence with the presence"}
{"note": "A 62-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of severe right abdominal pain for 4 months. A fixed stony-hard tumor of about 100 mm in diameter was found on palpation, with slight tenderness on the right side of her abdomen. A full blood examination gave values within the normal limit. Abdominal CT showed a large mass with diffuse calcification of size about 130 × 110 mm in the right retroperitoneal space between the right kidney and the inferior vena cava, with slight hydronephrosis (). Lymph node swelling, ascites, liver tumor, and lung tumor were not detected by chest and abdominal CT, and the patient had no history of trauma or radiation therapy at the tumor site. However, the patient had undergone bilateral resection of tumors of the adrenal glands on the left side at the age of 46 years old and on the right side at at the age of 50 years old. Pathological findings revealed that both adrenal gland tumors were pheochromocytoma and no adjuvant therapy was administered. This led to a preoperative diagnosis of recurrent pheochromocytoma or retroperitoneal osteosarcoma or leiomyosarcoma. There were no carcinomas or sarcomas in her history or in her family history.\nComplete surgical resection of the primary tumor was performed. The tumor was situated behind the mesenterium of the ascending colon, compressing the right kidney, but no direct invasion of the surrounding organs was observed: there was no lymph node swelling, ascites or peritoneal dissemination, and the tumor was not present in the parenchyma of the liver and the kidney. The surgical margin was determined based on the rough connective tissue surrounding the tumor. Dissection of lymph nodes was not performed.\nGross examination revealed a rounded, bony, and hard tumor of size about 140 × 110 × 80 mm and weight 1100 g that was yellowish-white in color (). Histologically, the tumor consisted of a mixture of dense fibrous tissue, woven bone, and atypical cartilage. Some osteoclastic giant cells were observed. Woven bone trabeculae were arranged irregularly and were anastomosed"}

A CT scan of the abdomen was performed at that time and demonstrated extensive inflammatory changes in the right lower quadrant with possible interloop abscess (). Two nonspecific calcifications were noted radiographically and the differential diagnosis included appendicitis, ileitis, or diverticulitis. He did not have any urinary complaints at that time. He underwent an uneventful open appendectomy and had resolution of his initial symptoms and no further follow up.\nThe patient presented again in August 2011 with right flank pain and urinary symptoms. A noncontrast CT scan of the abdomen was performed and demonstrated a right ureterovesicular junction calculus with mild right ureteral dilation (). Again, calcifications were noted near the anterior fundus of the bladder (). He was managed medically and discharged with instructions to follow up with an urologist as an outpatient.\nHe subsequently presented again 3 weeks later with severe abdominal pain and induration of his lower abdominal wall. CT imaging now demonstrated interval enlargement of a complex cystic mass inseparable from the anterior superior wall of the urinary balder and abutting the posterior margin of the abdominal wall (). The radiographic diagnosis was an urachal remnant abscess versus tumor. He denied any urologic complaints at that time. He was started on antibiotics, and surgical consultation was performed. After an extensive discussion with the patient regarding his radiographic diagnosis and suspicion of complications related to an urachal remnant, he was scheduled for cystoscopy and surgical exploration.\nAt the time of surgery, cystoscopy did not demonstrate any abnormalities of the bladder. Exploratory laparotomy was performed and an indurated mass and abscess were encountered near the area of the anterior abdominal wall and bladder. The abscess was drained and a few small calcifications were encountered and removed for pathologic examination. A complete exploration was performed and the phlegmon appeared to be limited to the dome of the bladder. This area was excised and"}

Working as a hairstylist when she was 18 or 19, she began to have severe pain in her hands, making her work very difficult. She had carpal tunnel surgery on her right hand which provided temporary relief. Her symptoms slowly returned and she continued to have intense pain and difficulty with her daily activities. Seeking relief from her symptoms, she received treatment from chiropractors and Chinese medicine practitioners with no significant benefit. She also tried yoga and swimming but depending on the yoga movements or swimming strokes, she began to have more pain.\nWhen she was in her early forties, she began to have weakness in the lower half of her body. Her legs would frequently give out on the stairs, causing her to fall. Control of her bladder and bowel function also began to deteriorate. She had an MRI, and based on the results, she was scheduled for emergency surgery to stabilize her cervical spine and relieve spinal cord compression. She was informed that it would be an outpatient surgery and she would be home the same day.\nIn May 2011, Susan had a 6-level cervical spine fusion to stabilize her spine and relieve pressure on her spinal cord. When she woke up, she realized something was wrong. The entire right side of her body was paralyzed. What was supposed to be an outpatient surgery with a return home the same day ended up being an 8-week hospital and rehabilitation stay to learn how to walk again.\nIn August 2012, a second surgery was performed with the goal of pain relief. However, she reported her pain was significantly worse afterwards. She would receive weekly injections for pain relief that she reports would only marginally decrease her pain for about one week.

She was managed with one month of bed rest and then she was mobilized without any support. She regained functional mobility but developed a hunchback.\nAt ten years of age, she developed fever, hemoptysis, swelling over back with pus like discharge, and weight loss for which she was admitted in another centre for one month and was diagnosed as a case of Pott's spine and treated with antitubercular drugs. She did not receive any formal education and used to do all household chores with no restriction in daily activities. She was married at the age of 20 years and conceived spontaneously. She became aware of pregnancy after she felt quickening at four months of gestation and went to the nearest primary health centre which was at a distance of two hours from her home on foot.

In her personal medical history, she had used misoprostol for medical abortion 6 and 3 years previously. There was no history of smoking, alcoholic beverage consumption, or drug abuse during the pregnancy, and no hereditary anomalies were identified in her family.\nA male neonate who weighed 2400 g was born at 34 weeks and 4 days of gestation by cesarean section. His Apgar scores were 10 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes. At birth, we noticed an amniotic band that consisted of a layer of annular amniotic tissue approximately 1 cm wide, which was tightened around the upper third of the right upper limb. The distal limb displayed cyanoderma, edema of the extremity, and focal peeling, with no autonomous activities or reactions of tenderness (). An X-ray showed a negative result for the humerus, but clear swelling of the soft tissues (). During the operation, the space between the amniotic band and upper limb skin was carefully separated and the band was cut off directly. The neonate was then transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. Four hours later, swelling of the right limb was further aggravated, the radial artery could not be reached, and the local skin color did not improve. Hypoperfusion of the limb was continued and the limb remained insensate without motor compromise (). We considered the possibility that further necrosis of the limb and local toxin absorption could lead to death of the neonate. We decided to amputate the upper third of the right upper extremity. The patient was relatively stable during anesthesia and successfully underwent surgery (). No severe complications occurred after the operation. The incision was almost healed without infection, dehiscence, or other complications, as observed by postoperative X-ray images (). The neonate recovered rapidly and was discharged 9 days after surgery. The stitches"}
{"note": "The index patient was a 34-year old female referred to the bariatric clinic by the general practitioner on her own request to treat her morbid obesity. She was born with a normal birth weight but large head circumference for which she never had a diagnostic analysis. At the age of five, her body weight was already significantly higher compared to her peers. No specific life events could explain her obesity. Cognitive development was normal and she followed normal education. She underwent treatment for recurrent nasal polyps. Her mother also had a large head size and suffered from morbid obesity as well. She was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and died from a pulmonary embolism after placement of an Adjustable Gastric Band. A maternal aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 50 and the maternal grandmother died from breast cancer at young age. The younger sister of the index patient was overweight and was reported to also have a large head size (Figure ).\nSince childhood, the index patient followed several different coaching programs to change her eating behavior and exercise pattern to induce weight loss. She lost weight several times but was never able to maintain her weight loss. At the time of the intake procedure at the bariatric clinic, her height was 1.69 m (SD −0.2) and weight 164 kg (SD +6.8), resulting in a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 57.6 kg/m2 and a predominant abdominal obesity. Head size was not measured at that time since this is not part of bariatric screening procedures. Biochemical analysis of the blood revealed no abnormalities, and excluded endocrine hormonal disorders such as hypothyroidism. The fasting glucose level was 5.9 mM.\nThe combination of early onset morbid obesity resulted in suspicion of a genetic cause of her obesity. She was offered diagnostic genetic analysis of 52 obesity–associated genes to identify a possible underlying genetic obesity cause.\nThe patient was eligible for bariatric surgery and underwent a sleeve gastrectomy without complications (performed in 2014 using a standardized fashion).

He visited a general practitioner each time, and the condition was resolved with analgesic and antibiotics. However, his symptoms got worse and he attended our Oral Surgery Clinic for consultation.\nThe patient is a fit and healthy young man with no relevant medical history and no known history of allergy. Past surgical history revealed that he had underwent bimaxillary orthognathic surgery one and half year earlier in a local hospital. Although the postoperative period was uneventful, the surgical team informed him that there was a dislodged orthodontic appliance in his right cheek that must have occurred during the operation. The team explained to the patient that this accident was realized later on the next day after the surgery when the molar tube from the right maxillary second molar was found missing, and its presence was confirmed high up in the right maxillary-zygomatic buttress area shown in the postoperative X-ray image taken on the next day following the surgery. A series of further postoperative radiographs confirmed its location, lying outside the right maxillary antrum. Due to the pronounced postoperative facial oedema at that time, no attempt was made to remove the appliance. The absence of sign and symptoms during further follow-up sessions confirmed the decision to leave it in-situ with continuous clinical observation.\nOn examination, there was no extraoral swelling noted. The mandible and maxilla seemed firm indicating good healing following previous mandibular saggital split and maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy sites and a stable class I dental occlusion. Intraorally, there was a sinus with slight pus discharge on the upper right buccal sulcus region adjacent to the upper right first premolar. All teeth in that quadrant were firm and vital. Tenderness was elicited upon palpation on the upper right vestibular region. We suspected the sinus track may originate from the dislodged appliance embedded in the cheek soft tissue.

She was gravida 2, with one previous miscarriage and had a metallic mitral valve prosthesis as a result of a childhood episode of rheumatic fever. Except for her cardiac disease, which was under control, she led a normal life and was employed as a social worker. This woman discovered that she was pregnant in the first trimester of gestation, and without consulting her physician, stopped using her anticoagulants. She was late in initiating antenatal care and consequently her referral to a specialized antenatal clinic was also delayed. When she was in the 25th week of gestation, she reached the third level of care and was admitted to the obstetrics ward where she was prescribed 10,000 units of unfractionated heparin twice a day. During her third night in the hospital, after receiving subcutaneous heparin for almost 72 hours (at that time the dose had been increased to 12,000 units twice a day), she developed headache, nausea, vomiting and mental confusion. At that time, physical examination revealed a stiff neck, but no focal neurological deficits were noted. The patient's pupils showed isocoria and were reactive to light, and she had a Glasgow coma score of 11. During this initial phase of hospitalization, her blood pressure and pulse remained within the normal range. APTT (Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time) was 57 seconds. A computerized tomography scan displayed an intraparenchymatous haematoma with bloody obliteration of the ventricles. The patient underwent neurosurgical drainage of this lesion and was admitted to the obstetrical intensive care unit, where postoperative care and ventilatory support was continued. During the following hours, her neurological status deteriorated progressively and on the following day, the patient appeared to have gone into a non-reactive coma with no sign of brainstem activity. Maternal brain death was confirmed by a transcranial Doppler scan of the cerebral arteries. At that time, foetal weight was estimated at 660 g according to ultrasound evaluation."}

Despite treatment with short course systemic antibiotics the lesions had enlarged and gradually extended to the forearm and hand and also to her fingers. She was referred to us for the evaluation of the eruption. The patient was not febrile and denied having been scratched by any cat. She had had no previous illness nor received any immunosuppressive drugs. On physical examination, multiple tender erythematous angiomatous papules and nodules in a grouped pattern were seen on the extensor aspect of the right arm that extended to the distal part in varying sizes of 1 to 2 cm in diameter []. The remainder of her skin was essentially normal, with no signs of a blistering or erythematous background. There was revealed painful axillary lymphadenopathy on general examination. There was no sign of a mucous membrane lesion or hepatosplenomegaly. It became evident that she also suffers from severe pruritus and occasionally bleeding in the papules. Routine laboratory blood tests, CD4 count were normal. ELISA tests for HIV were negative. No evidence of other immunosuppressive status was revealed by various systemic examinations. Histopathological examination showed an epidermal collaret with mild hyperkeratosis with focal parakeratosis and crust formation. In the dermis, proliferation of blood vessels and inflammatory cells were seen. The vascular component in the upper dermis was constituted by thin-walled vessels lined by plump, and deeper are small and thick-walled vessels []. The inflammatory cells were composed of lymphocytes and some eosinophils and neutrophils. In some areas eosinophilic granular material was present. The silver stain revealed a small number of bacilli like organisms []; we diagnosed the patient's eruption as BA.

{"note": "A 57-year-old male Han Chinese patient was admitted to our hospital in September 2018 due to neck discomfort. Physical examination on admission showed a local bulge on the right side of the neck, while the trachea was shifted to the left. Clinical examination revealed a large lump on the right lobe of the thyroid gland, which was approximately 5 × 4 cm in size. His previous medical history showed that he was admitted to the hospital in June 2007 due to painless hematuria and was diagnosed with right renal carcinoma. He then underwent radical resection of the right renal carcinoma. Postoperative pathological examination showed a moderately differentiated right ccRCC (stage III), and the patient did not receive further treatment after the operation. The re-examination of kidneys was done every year through ultrasound, which showed no abnormal echo in the right renal fossa. Ultrasound examination in July 2012 in our hospital showed the presence of multiple thyroid nodules, and the size of the largest nodule was about 1.2 × 0.6 cm, which was present in the right lobe with a clear boundary and homogenous echo. The patient refused the treatment because he was asymptomatic. Color ultrasound examination of thyroid in March 2015 revealed that the size of the largest nodule with clear boundary in the right lobe was about 2.5 × 1.3 cm, but the echo was heterogeneous, and small patchy fluid sonolucent area was found in the lesion. Color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) showed circular blood flow signals around the nodule and poor blood flow signals inside the nodule (Fig. ). So, re-examination by ultrasound was suggested due to his previous medical history. The results of the ultrasound examination conducted in September 2018 showed an evident increase in the volume of the right thyroid lobe, and the shape of the right lobe also remained abnormal. The thickness of the right lobe was 4.6 cm. Multiple hypoechoic nodules were detected in the thyroid gland, and the size of the largest nodule was about 5.6 × 3.7 cm ("}

Preoperative physical examination revealed a Lachman test score of 3+ and a KneeLax examination, in which a 132 N force was applied, showed a 10-mm slippage of the affected knee compared with the unaffected one. The diagnosis of ACL tear was confirmed using MRI. The patient underwent arthroscopic anatomic double-bundle reconstruction using hamstring tendons in a surgical procedure that was the same as that described in case 1.\nPostoperative CT revealed that the distance between the TR button and the exit of the tunnel on the lateral femoral cortex was 0 mm for the AM bundle and 0.5 mm for the PL bundle (). She undertook routine rehabilitation. At six months after the operation, she felt a slight lateral knee pain on the TR button of the PL bundle. However, she was able to carry out her routine rehabilitation schedule and return to playing judo. One year after the surgery, she could play judo and participate in competitions, but the lateral pain did not disappear and a slight swelling occurred on the lateral side of the knee. The lateral pain was not dependent on the knee flexion angle. She wanted to remove the TR buttons at the time of the second arthroscopy. TR buttons of both AM and PL bundles were removed; that of the PL bundle was just beneath the ITB. In addition, the adjustable loop in the TR of the PL bundle had partially worn out, and therefore was easily removed. A second arthroscopic evaluation of the graft indicated that the reconstructed ACL had good synovial coverage and rigid tensioning and the graft had been incorporated into the femoral bone tunnel. After removal of the TR button, graft tensioning and incorporation did not change and the lateral knee pain immediately disappeared. Therefore, we considered that the lateral pain was related to irritation between the TR"}

It was diagnosed to be dentigerous cyst that required excision due to its painful symptomatology. He was an established case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy since childhood and was confined to wheel chair since then. The child had no history of recent upper respiratory tract infection or previous anesthetic exposures. On physical examination, the weight of the child was measured to be 48 kg and he had wasting of muscles in both the lower limbs with motor power of grade II. Airway examination revealed mouth opening of >3 cm with modified Mallampati grade of II, normal thyromental and mento-hyoid distance and normal range of neck movements []. Examination of the back revealed a mild scoliosis involving the thoraco-lumbar region with convexity toward the right side. Cardiovascular and respiratory system examination was unremarkable. The laboratory investigations were all within normal limits except for raised creatine kinase levels of 1823 IU/L (normal 75–230). The electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia and biventricular hypertrophy and findings of echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 32% with moderate depression of the left ventricular systolic function. The child was planned for excision of dentigerous cyst. During the preoperative visit, the child and the parents were highly anxious about the procedure but after careful counseling and discussion of various implications and the risks associated with general anesthesia, the parents and the child agreed to undergo the procedure under procedural sedation.

On history the patient reported some chronic pain in the right upper quadrant, which had been present in the previous days, which suddenly had become worse prior to admission to the hospital. Past medical history was completely unremarkable. On clinical examination the patient appeared pale and in distress. Blood pressure was 80/60 mm Hg, heart rate was 120, and respiratory rate was 40. The abdomen was painful with guarding and rebound in all four quadrants. Laboratory tests showed Hb of 69 g/dL and WBC 15.000 μL. A FAST ultrasound performed in emergency showed an eight by five cm lesion in segments V and VI of the liver, with diffuse hemoperitoneum. An emergency abdominal CT scan was requested, and it showed evidence of an eight by five cm ruptured hepatic lesion with massive hemoperitoneum and leakage of contrast medium. The lesion had a big extrahepatic component with possible invasion of the hepatoduodenal ligament and gallbladder (). While the CT scan was being performed the patient became clinically unstable, and therefore decision was taken to bring the patient to the operating room for an emergency surgery. In the operating room, a Chevron incision was performed to gain access into the abdomen. Packing of the liver together with a Pringle maneuver was performed to achieve hepatic inflow occlusion and slow down the bleeding. After aspiration of three liters of blood that had been accumulating in the abdominal cavity we proceeded to a thorough inspection of the bleeding mass in the liver. The mass was invading the hepatoduodenal ligament, and it was extending into but not penetrating the second part of the duodenum (). No other visible masses were seen in the liver or in the peritoneal cavity.

{"note": "A 49 year old gentleman presented to cardiology with lower limb claudication pain and breathlessness of three years duration. Clinical examination revealed upper limb hypertension, with similar blood pressures in both arms (180/100 mm Hg). His past history included repair of coarctation of aorta about 30 years ago. The medical records and operative details from the previous operation were unavailable. The operation had been performed through a left thoracotomy. An MRI scan revealed a 2 cm long narrowing of the aorta just distal to the origin of an aberrant right subclavian artery, which was the last of four branches from the aortic arch (Fig. ). The origins of the arch vessels did not show any sign of narrowing. The aortic root and ascending aorta were 3.5 cm in diameter, and the arch was of normal calibre. The diameter in the region of the stenosis was 1.4 cm with an additional web-like stenotic lesion at the distal end of the stenotic segment. There was evidence of calcification, possibly of an interposition tube graft which had been used at the time of the first operation. The descending thoracic aorta was of normal calibre.\nIn view of his symptomatic status, a re-intervention was considered appropriate. In view of his previous surgery, and especially the fact that the area of re-coarctation appeared to be calcified, it was decided to approach the aorta via a median sternotomy and construct an extra-anatomic ascending to descending thoracic aorta bypass graft. Cardiopulmonary bypass would be necessary to lift the heart out of the way to gain access to the descending thoracic aorta just above the diaphragm. We planned to use an apical suction device to keep the empty beating heart elevated.\nThe sternotomy was completed uneventfully. The pericardial cavity was obliterated with dense adhesions. This was rather surprising since we had anticipated that the previous procedure would have been extra-pericardial. However, further dissection revealed a large hole in the pericardial sac with the left lung directly adherent to the heart. The adhesions were released, some"}
{"note": "A 49-year-old female experiencing untreated hypertension for several years presented with severe chest and back pain. A CT scan was performed and revealed an aortic dissection (Stanford type B) and an intimal flap was noted immediately distal from the origin of the left subclavian artery. After 4 days of medical management, her urine output decreased and both femoral pulses were weakened. Another CT scan was performed, showing that the aortic dissection had worsened and there was nearly total occlusion of the mid-aorta (). We recommended aortic repair operation, which the patient and her family refused. TEVAR was recommended as another treatment option to cover the intimal flap of the dissection. To acquire the proper proximal landing zone, her left subclavian artery and two thirds of the origin of the left common carotid artery would be covered by the stent graft. For the occluded left subclavian artery, revascularization can then be selectively considered in a staged approach if left arm pain, claudication and subclavian steal syndrome develop. The modified chimney technique was planned to preserve the blood flow of the left common carotid artery. The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory and a left femoral arteriotomy was performed under general anesthesia. The 035 inch wire was placed in the ascending aorta and the left subclavian artery through the left radial artery approach. This wire is important to rescue the left carotid artery flow. If an aortic stent graft totally covers the left carotid artery or if it is difficult to select the left carotid artery with a catheter, then we can perform emergency balloon dilatation and place a chimney graft stent from the left subclavian artery to the aorta via this wire. The deployment of a 38×150 mm SEAL aortic stent graft (S&G Biotech, Seongnam, Korea) was performed so that the proximal part of the stent graft covered two thirds of the ostium of the left common carotid artery.

{"note": "A 32-year-old healthy pregnant woman with more than 30 gestational weeks was admitted to the hospital due to the fetal cardiac mass. The fetal echocardiography showed a heterogeneous lesion of 2.85 cm × 2.25 cm on the right side of the heart, which compressed the tricuspid annulus by 50% with pericardial effusion []. It was difficult to distinguish the source of fetal cardiac mass either within the heart or in the pericardial cavity by fetal echocardiography. The fetus was at risk when the fetal heart rate decreased to less than 80 bpm and pericardial effusion continued to increase during the hospitalization. The EXIT procedure was performed to resect fetal cardiac tumor if it was located in the pericardial cavity or to ameliorate cardiac compression and bradycardia by pericardial effusion drainage.\nThe cesarean section was performed, and the uterine relaxation was attained with the inhalation of a high dose of sevoflurane (5–10%). The fetus was released from the uterus, and the placental circulation was kept intact. The fetal heart was exposed through the median sternotomy. The mass was located within the right atrium and hence could not be quickly removed without cardiopulmonary bypass. Therefore, about 30 ml of pericardial effusion was drained, and the skin was just sutured without closing the sternum to release the space for the cardiac mass. The tricuspid annulus compression was ameliorated as demonstrated by fetal echocardiography []. The fetus delivered weighed 2.2 kg and had a sinus rhythm of 130–150 bpm. The cesarean section was completed with the administration of oxytocin and termination of sevoflurane inhalation after fetal delivery. The pregnant woman recovered uneventfully and was discharged on the 5th day postoperatively.\nThe neonate was intubated with mechanical respiratory support, and his heart function was still impaired by the cardiac mass compression. Dopamine was administered at a rate of 10 μg·kg−1·min−1 to maintain the mean blood pressure ranging from 40 to 50 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa).

He felt a ‘shock’ at the right cheek as if hit by something hard while operating a construction vehicle. Bleeding from the skin of the right cheek was observed but stopped after a few minutes of applying pressure to the site. In a few days, swelling developed on the right side of his face accompanied by a slight trismus. He visited a dental office and was prescribed antibiotics and referred to our department. The patient was well-built, and the right side of his face was diffusely swollen. The wound at the site of penetration was not remarkable. Panorama and posteroanterior X-ray examination revealed a small radiopaque foreign body at the lateral aspect of the right mandibular ramus. CT examination indicated that the foreign body was located under the masseter muscle. The foreign body was not palpable from the surface of the face or the oral mucosa. With the diagnosis of a foreign body on the right side of his face, the removal was planned after receiving medications for symptom improvement. However, the patient did not return to the hospital or for a follow-up appointment.\nIn 2015, the patient revisited our department for the removal of the foreign body. In 2008, he felt strong traction in the right side of his face when he approached an MRI scanner for a brain image examination. He remembered that a foreign body was impacted in his face. Because it was shown to be ferromagnetic, the MRI examination was cancelled and contraindicated. He was positive for the hepatitis C virus and suffering from liver cirrhosis. Recently, hepatocellular carcinoma had developed and was treated by radiofrequency ablation. His liver function was impaired and had a Child Pugh B score in addition to thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. Although esophageal varices were not observed, he needed to be strictly followed. Because MRI examination was necessary to evaluate this condition, the removal of the foreign body was reconsid"}
{"note": "A 12-year-old Brazilian female, with no systemic comorbidities, attended the oral and maxillofacial surgery service with a chief complaint of a painless growing facial swelling for 8 months (). On extraoral examination, a unilateral expansive lesion was detected on the lower right aspect of her face. On intraoral examination, the swelling could be seen affecting the body and the angle of the mandible on the right side associated with her lower right third molar. Panoramic radiographic examination revealed a unilocular radiolucent lesion extending from the body of the mandible through to the angle and right ascending ramus, causing displacement of the second molar towards the base of the mandible and the third molar towards the ascending ramus (). A CT scan revealed that the lesion caused expansion of the buccal and lingual aspects of the cortical bone with areas of fenestration. Needle aspiration was performed to evaluate the contents of the swelling, mainly to exclude the possibility of a vascular lesion. An incisional biopsy was then performed, and the specimen was sent for histological evaluation (). The access window left from the biopsy was used to accommodate a flexible tube for decompression and subsequent volume reduction of the lesion in an attempt to minimize the need for mutilating surgery in such a young patient. In view of the clinical and radiographic characteristics, two differential diagnoses were raised, namely, unicystic ameloblastoma or dentigerous cyst (). The histological diagnosis confirmed the suspicion of a unicystic ameloblastoma. A decision was made to continue with the assisted decompression approach using daily irrigations of sterile saline solution intercalated with 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate to remove debris and decontaminate the site, which was followed up both clinically and radiographically. After 5 months of decompression, a significant reduction of the lesion was observed radiographically, with evidence of bone neoformation in the periphery of the lesion. In view of the favorable progression, complete enucleation of the lesion combined with peripheral osteotomy and cryotherapy was performed under general anesthesia to reduce the risk of recurrence.

On arriving at the site the emergency team where the patient had the seizure, found her lying in a supin position with a foamy mouth and bitten tongue. A 2 cm cut was seen at the back of the head most probably as a result of falling and hitting it. The patient was found to have difficulty in breathing and after suction of the mouth, oxygen was administered. The general clinical condition being quite poor and having an apneic respiratory pattern, the patient was immediately intubated. The patient was unconscious with a blood pressure level of 80/60 mm Hg and pulse count of 66/min. Light reflexes were normal in the patient, there were no verbal and pain responses and the Babinski sign was bilateraly unresponsive. The patient was brought to the hospital by the emergency team in an intubated state and admitted to the neurology intensive care unit. The patient's hematologic and biochemical tests were unremarkable and the carbamazepine levels were found to be 3.8 µg/mL (4–12). The patient had been diagnosed with epilepsy and under follow up for 40 years, had a moderate level of mental retardation, did not use her medical treatment (carbamazepine 800 mg/day) regularly and failed to go for her routine medical checkups. It was also learned that she develops once or twice a month generalized tonic clonic seizures and that during some of these seizures she has suffered small injuries but had not had any fatal trauma or accident.

The patient also began to experience numbness of his left thumb, index and middle fingers. He was normally well and not on regular medications. There was no family history of note.\nAn ultrasound was initially performed which showed a large, complex cystic structure within the carpal tunnel. A subsequent MRI revealed a heterogeneous, well defined mass with fluid and solid components. The mass was located middle and ring fingers. It appeared to arise from the tendon sheath of the middle and ring finger flexors, but was not between the superficial and deep flexor tendon sheaths of the invading the tendons. It extended distally to the carpal tunnel, with overall dimensions of 19 x 24 x 38 mm. It showed peripheral enhancement and areas of necrosis, and there was no flow void (Fig. ). The median nerve had a normal appearance. In light of the clinical history and radiological features, a malignant lesion such a synovial sarcoma, was considered the likely provisional diagnosis.\nThe patient was referred to our unit for urgent review.

{"note": "The first patient (P1) was a 68-year old female, retired from work, and living with her husband. A few years ago she had had problems with her right jaw when chewing. Ever since then she had felt that her jaw was tense. At some point, she started to have light headaches now and then that accelerated to headaches almost every day. The headache was usually present already when she woke up in the morning. It seemed to get somewhat worse during days when she was stressed. She perceived her jaw muscles as tense and tender. She had low-intensity headaches most of the days ( and ), with no perceived disability but affecting feelings of happiness in activities with family and friends (). Her self-efficacy for managing headache (HMSE) was low (). She used analgesics but not that much that it would be a primary problem behavior ().\nIn the FBA, it was hypothesized that the behavior that would have most effect on her headaches was her continuous contracting of jaws. Therefore, the behavior of contracting the jaw muscles was analyzed in order to understand the function of the behavior. The behavior seemed to be going on almost all the time, even during nights, and in that way it had become more or less automatic. The antecedents and consequences of this behavior were therefore hard to identify. However, it could be concluded that the behavior was intensified in situations with psychological stress, for example, worrying about family members being ill. She was motivated for changing her behavior.\nThe long-term goal was set to no headache more than twice a week. It was concluded that the primary purpose of the treatment would be to find a way for her to increase the control of tension of the jaw during the daytime activities. It was hypothesized that the jaw muscles would continue to be relaxed during the nights if they were relaxed during the days.\nThe treatment consisted of eight visits with home exercises in between, including two follow-up visits."}
{"note": "During the dissection of a 91-year-old female cadaver, whose cause of death was reported as Alzheimer's disease, an enlarged gallbladder filled with approximately 350 ml of thin bilious fluid was identified. This gallbladder was normally situated in the fossa for the gallbladder. Upon opening, a prominent transverse partial septation in the body was found. This partial septum was located near the infundibulum (Hartmann's pouch) and this divided the gallbladder into a smaller chamber near the opening of the cystic duct and a larger chamber near the fundus (). There was a one centimeter opening between the two chambers allowing communication of fluid. No stones, mucus, or obstructive masses were found in the gallbladder or along its path of drainage into the duodenum. The diameter of the biliary duct system appeared enlarged; the cystic duct measured 12 mm (normal 2-3 mm), the hepatic duct 18 mm (normal 6 mm) and the common bile duct 21 mm (normal 7 mm), in the collapsed state [,]. The common bile duct, near its termination, measured 7 mm with a patent opening into the pancreaticobiliary antrum (). No anatomical explanation for the enlarged ductal system was found. It is possible that the patient passed a gallstone prior to death, causing a constriction at the pancreaticobiliary antrum and subsequent dilation of the biliary tree, but this is only conjecture. The gallbladder wall was of normal thickness and had no evidence of past inflammation in the form of adhesions or other structural changes. The liver appeared grossly normal. The authors hypothesize this septal abnormality was congenital and during life may have caused symptoms of biliary colic due to the septum intermittently obstructing the cystic duct during contraction of the gallbladder; this may have resulted in incomplete emptying of the gallbladder and subsequent enlargement.\nIn addition to the enlarged gallbladder, an aberrant right hepatic artery and an accessory left hepatic artery were found. The left hepatic artery was normally located but there was also an accessory left hepatic artery originating from the left gastric artery."}

Seeking relief from her symptoms, she received treatment from chiropractors and Chinese medicine practitioners with no significant benefit. She also tried yoga and swimming but depending on the yoga movements or swimming strokes, she began to have more pain.\nWhen she was in her early forties, she began to have weakness in the lower half of her body. Her legs would frequently give out on the stairs, causing her to fall. Control of her bladder and bowel function also began to deteriorate. She had an MRI, and based on the results, she was scheduled for emergency surgery to stabilize her cervical spine and relieve spinal cord compression.

For the last 2 years, her sickle cell pain included intermittent pain in the left ankle. Her recurrent severe VOCs were treated with opioids, as they are the general treatment in such patients. She had experienced osteomyelitis in the right ulnar bone 12 years previously, which resolved after intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Additionally, she underwent splenectomy 4 years ago to reduce blood transfusion requirements because of her congenital hemolytic anemia. She was referred for a triple-phase bone scan and complementary bone marrow and infection imaging as part of the SCD research project. A plain radiograph of the left foot was normal, but SPECT-CT revealed an increased uptake in the shoulders, knees, and sternum on blood pool and delayed images, consistent with marrow expansion. A similar uptake pattern was seen during bone marrow study, confirming bone marrow expansion around the large joints. There was a mildly increased blood pool and bone uptake in the left ankle involving the proximal talus and the region of the medial malleolus, with focal increased uptake in the left talus. This nidus of activity appeared to correspond to a round lucent area surrounded by a dense sclerotic rim and sinus tract formation together with a fracture line in the proximal talus on CT. The WBC scan showed no evidence of significant uptake, and the bone marrow scan showed asymmetrical uptake between the two ankles without a cold lesion in the left talus, which is consistent with moderate bone marrow expansion. The CT and bone scan findings suggested Brodie’s abscess in the proximal left talus with possible surrounding chronic osteomyelitis. Intravenous antibiotics were administered for 10 days with no response. The abscess was then treated with surgical curettage under general anesthesia and antibiotic administration for 10 days. At 18 months after removal of the abscess, the patient did not have pain or swelling at the site of the abscess even with sickle cell VOC."}

He also complained of bad odor and difficulty to open his mouth during the same period. On examination intra-orally, a hard bone-like structure with a rough surface exposed to the oral cavity distal to the right lower second molar was seen. Plaque accumulation over the mass with very foul odor and bad oral hygiene was noticed. The hard mass fenestrated the lingual tissues together with the gingival surrounding the lesion appearing very inflamed (Figures ). Ortho-pantomo-graphic x-ray view showed a calcified mass distal to the lower right second molar, with the third molar on that side being displaced distally by the present mass. The calcified mass was encircled inferiorly on its central part by a radiolucent halo with the inferior dental canal being more inferiorly placed to the lesion. The lower right second molar showed advanced periodontal involvement with bone loss but without any resorption of its distal root ().\nHe consented for the potential complications of surgically removing the mass in terms of inferior alveolar and lingual nerves injury, and possible pathologic fracture of the right side of the lower jaw while removing the lesion. The proposed treatment plan also included disimpaction of lower right third molar and extraction of periodontally involved second molar. He accepted the proposed treatment under local anesthesia but refused the extraction of the lower right second molar. Under local anesthesia, the surgical removal of the lower right third molar in addition to the calcified mass together with curettage of the infected soft tissues in the area was carried over. The specimens sent for histopathological examination included the soft tissues around the lesion and the hard, calcified lesion.

She had one bowel movement but the abdominal pain persisted. The pain was intermittent and gradually worsened. She vomited several times. She underwent a hernia repair 15 years previously and had a lower midline incision, although the details of that procedure were unavailable. On physical examination, her lower abdomen was slightly distended with mild tenderness to palpation. Dilated intestine was palpable, but there were no signs of peritonitis. Nasogastric suction was initiated but inadequate and the abdominal pain persisted. Abdominal CT scan revealed dilated loops of small intestine with a small amount of ascites.\nThe diagnosis of small bowel obstruction was established and exploration undertaken. This was begun laparoscopically which demonstrated multiple areas of adherent loops of small bowel. The adhesions were lysed sharply and further exploration revealed a small bowel perforation, which was repaired in a conventional manner after conversion to open laparotomy.\nOn postoperative day (POD) 1, her temperature increased to 39°C; however, it resolved over five days without specific treatment. The abdominal pain persisted and became more intense on POD 6. Abdominal CT scan was performed on POD 7, which showed a small fluid collection with some air. Due to persistence and increasing severity of the abdominal pain, repeat operative exploration was undertaken on POD 8. Exploration revealed abscesses in the abdominal wall and between loops of small bowel, as well as a site of perforation, which was resected and repaired with a primary anastomosis.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful except for persistent anorexia. Ten days after the second exploration, CT scan was obtained due to the persistent anorexia. The CT scan revealed edematous small intestine and dilatation of the mesenteric veins.

On examination her leg was shortened and externally rotated. AP and lateral radiographs of her hip confirmed an extracapsular neck of femur fracture, as shown in . After discussion with the patient and her family, consent was taken for internal fixation of the fracture using a dynamic hip screw. Preoperative blood workup revealed a mild anaemia (Hb of 110 g/L) and chronic kidney disease stage 3.\nSurgery was performed on the following day's trauma list by a registrar under image intensifier guidance, as shown in . The procedure was supervised by a consultant surgeon. The procedure appeared to be routine with no intraoperative complications noted. The following day the patient had a persistent tachycardia with low oxygen saturations on arterial blood gas sampling.

{"note": "In this case report, we describe a variant mesenteric artery originating directly from the abdominal aorta between the origin of the SMA and IMA in a 85-year-old Caucasian female body donor during routine dissection of the supracolic and infracolic regions. The cause of death in the donor was indicated as myocardial infarction. No past medical records were available for review.\nDuring the exposure of the celiac artery, superior and inferior mesenteric arteries, the intestinal loops were moved to the right and the peritoneum covering the posterior abdominal wall removed. The celiac artery and the superior mesenteric artery originated independently from the ventral surface of the abdominal aorta about 1 cm apart (Fig. ). The CA had a normal branching pattern (Fig. ). Branches from the SMA included the inferior pancreaticoduodenal, right colic, ileocolic, jejunal and ileal arteries. A middle colic artery that usually arises from the SMA was missing. The IMA was found to originate from the ventrolateral surface of the distal abdominal aorta about 6 cm from the origin of the SMA, and it gave rise to the sigmoid arteries and superior rectal artery. The left colic artery that usually takes its origin from the IMA was also missing.\nBetween the SMA and IMA, an additional mesenteric artery was found to originate from the ventrolateral surface of the distal aorta, about 2 cm proximal to the origin of the IMA (Fig. ). From its origin on the abdominal aorta, the variant artery ran obliquely superiorly toward the left colic flexure. It then gave rise to two branches, which had free anastomosis within the mesocolon of the transverse and descending colon. The first branch ran transversally to the left to supply the proximal part of the descending colon.

However, for the past one week, the patient reported mild pain. On clinical examination, there was a diffuse, proliferative soft tissue growth of the maxilla extending from the marginal gingiva in the palatal aspect of the anterior tooth and involving the entire surface of the hard palate up to the level of the hard and soft palate junction along with erythema of attached gingiva in relation to posterior teeth palatally and buccally as well as Grade III mobility of all the anterior and posterior maxillary teeth (Figures and ). The cervical group of lymph nodes were nonpalpable clinically.\nThe referring private practitioner had advised a panoramic radiograph earlier which revealed severe bone loss in relation to maxillary teeth suggestive of generalized periodontitis and was inconclusive for any other relevant findings except for a root stump in the lower right quadrant ().\nThe patient was advised for a CBCT scan which revealed a moth-eaten appearance of the palate noticed bilaterally with involvement of nasopalatine canal anteriorly and external resorption of roots in relation to all the maxillary teeth present, with evidence of involvement of anterior and middle ethmoidal sinus, eustachian tube, and nasopharynx on the right side.

{"note": "The patient is a 46-year-old female with SCC of the breast. She initially had silicone gel breast implantation for breast augmentation in 1995. The implantation was surgically revised in 2002 and 2006. In 2014 she noticed hardening and swelling of her right breast. Because of the death of her husband, she did not seek immediate medical attention. She continued to have swelling and increased pain in the right breast. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in January 2016 showed a large fluid collection surrounding the intact right silicone implant as shown in Figure . The case was managed by surgical drainage of fluid collection and capsulectomy. In February 2016, she underwent bilateral prosthesis explantation and bilateral capsulectomy. The pathology demonstrated a 4-cm moderately differentiated invasive SCC. It extended into the muscle, and in situ tumor was noted to extend to the peripheral margin. There was no perineural or lymphovascular invasion. Pathology of the left breast capsule showed chronic inflammation. Computed tomography (CT) of chest, abdomen and pelvis on February 2016 revealed absence of metastatic disease. The patient underwent re-excision of the remaining chest wall mass in March 2016. Pathology showed well differentiated SCC with negative margins. Chest wall fluid was negative for malignant cells. On slide review, it was noted that there was squamous epithelialization of the implant capsule with benign squamous epithelium on both sides. This indicated that the tumor is likely SCC of the implant capsule rather than primary SCC of the breast. Estrogen and progesterone receptor markers were negative as well. Afterwards, she received external beam radiation. She was treated with radiation while supine with free breathing. Four tangent beams were used to target the right breast with 50 Gray in 25 fractions, followed by a 10 Gray boost to the tumor bed delivered in five fractions. Radiation was delivered using opposed tangents completed in May 2016. No adjuvant chemotherapy was offered due to the rare histology and paucity of data.

He had no medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, tuberculosis, and hepatitis, and as for family history, his mother had suffered from cerebral hemorrhage.\nBrain computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography carried out on admission showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) with hydrocephalus, and a tortuous vascular structure that was observed around the brain stem and upper cervical spinal cord (). Cerebral angiography was performed when vital signs had been stabilized and headache had been controlled through conservative treatments. The cerebral angiogram on the left vertebral artery revealed multiple vascular structures around the V4 segment of the left vertebral artery, which were drained to both sides of the sigmoid sinus and vertebral venous plexus. A cerebral angiogram on the external carotid artery showed multiple vascular structures around the occipital artery, which were connected to the drained vein observed via the left vertebral artery angiogram. Embolization was attempted on the left occipital artery and the distal V2 segment of the left vertebral artery, but the treatment was halted due to reflux. Another embolization was performed from the V4 and V3 segment to some of the distal V2 segment of the left vertebral artery. The treatment was terminated after partial occlusion was identified (). As mental deterioration and left hemiplegia were observed after the embolization, cerebral angiography and brain CT were conducted. However, new lesions such as cerebral hemorrhages or vascular occlusions were not found. One week after the embolization, follow-up brain CT displayed subacute cerebral infarction on the left cerebellum and thalamus, and a mild mass effect on the fourth ventricle and brain stem. The patient still felt drowsy and scored 14 on the GCS after being transferred to the department of rehabilitation medicine. Manual muscle tests of the left upper and"}

She was noted during colonoscopy to have a fungating rectal polyp. The polyp had multiple fingerlike projections and did not saline lift. Multiple biopsies were taken and pathology was consistent with fragments of tubulovillous adenoma and granulation tissue. A follow-up colonoscopy was then performed 2 months later which noted a single frond-like, villous, broad-based rectal polyp that appeared to be located within a diverticulum (fig. ), and which had an area of distorted mucosal pattern consistent with malignancy (fig. ). A solution of saline and SPOT was injected into the submucosa but, similar to the previous procedure, the polyp did not lift. Endoscopic mucosal resection was attempted but was unsuccessful. At that point the patient was referred to Colorectal Surgery for a surgical evaluation. Based on the location of the polyp, the recommendation was for a low anterior resection.\nA preoperative CT scan demonstrated a dilated appendix with its tip near the rectum which was of unclear significance at that time (fig. ). During surgery, the appendix was found to be densely adherent to the right anterior rectal wall at the area that had been inked during colonoscopy. En bloc resection of the distal sigmoid colon and proximal rectum together with the appendix was performed (fig. ). At that time, frozen sections of both the distal rectal resection margin as well as of the appendix were performed. The distal margin was negative for carcinoma. There was a mass at the tip of the appendix with mucin in the lumen which extended proximally but did not extend beyond the distal one half of the appendix. The proximal appendix was normal in appearance (fig. ). The decision was made not to proceed with additional resection at that time but to await final pathology in order to guide further treatment.

The mass grew over a presumed keloid scar, which developed approximately 1 month following a motor vehicle accident 12 years prior. During the accident, he suffered a contusion to the left shoulder that first bruised and subsequently formed a golf ball-sized mass. There was no breakage of skin on the left shoulder. He sought medical attention for the skin lesion at that time and was diagnosed with keloid, which was readily accepted as he had past medical history and similar family history. No treatment for the lesion was performed at that time. Since then, the lesion had been stable without any change in shape, color, or size until 1.5 years prior to evaluation, when he suffered a minor trauma to the lesion during a work-related injury that did not break the skin barrier. Following this event, he noticed that the lesion slowly increased in size under the skin without apparent cutaneous changes in appearance. Two months before the clinical encounter, he noticed a new rapidly growing nodule on the surface of the initial mass. He noticed no changes in symptomatology other than left shoulder pain and limited range of motion of the neck that became more prominent as the mass increased in size.\nOn examination, there were three discrete protuberant tumor nodules, gray-white, involving the skin and subcutis. The largest nodule measured 16 × 15 × 7 cm and the smallest nodule measured 7 × 6 × 3 cm ().\nThe tumor was ulcerated and necrotic without apparent attachment to underlying structures. Anterior cervical, posterior cervical, supraclavicular, and axillary lymph nodes were not palpable bilaterally, and there were no other masses observed.

His oncology history began in July 2007 in another cancer center, after the surgical removal of an expansive lesion on his left hand achieving a complete negative margin (R0) resection. Histological findings of the lesion highlighted a monophasic synovial sarcoma. He was administered adjuvant local radiotherapy and was then followed up. In June 2008, a computed tomography (CT) scan detected local recurrence of the disease and appearance of new nodules in the middle and apical right pulmonary lobe; therefore, the patient underwent another surgery of the hand and local excision of the lung tumor, which was confirmed by the previous histological diagnosis. Taking into account the dissemination of the disease, in August 2008, he was treated with systemic chemotherapy including 4 cycles of epirubicin in combination with ifosfamide. After about 1 year, in May 2009, progression of the disease into the right lung was recorded; therefore, the patient underwent another 3 wedge resections (anterior segment of the lower and upper right lobe), which is a diagnostic for metastasis of synovial sarcoma. He was followed up with only clinical and instrumental controls (CT scan and laboratory tests). After several years, in June 2012, a contralateral progression of the pulmonary disease was detected (1 lesion in the lower left lobe) and CT scan showed pathological mediastinal lymph nodes. A wedge resection of the dorsal segment of the lower lobe was performed, histologically compatible with metastases, and 2 hilar and lobar lymph nodes, which had become inflammatory, were removed. According to the patient, he continued to be followed up until December 2015 when he was submitted once again to a wedge resection of the middle lobe for sarcoma metastases. After 10 months, the patient reported intermittent episodes of hemoptysis in the absence of other symptoms; the CT scan showed significant thoracic disease progression associated with pulmonary artery compression.

Initially, the lesion was ~1 cm in diameter and occasionally accompanied by paresthesias and bleeding after friction. He had normal urination and did not visit the hospital at first. When an ulcer developed, he applied erythromycin ointment. Sometimes, the focal ulceration\nhealed, but the condition often recurred. The scope of the lesion gradually increased over the period of 7 years. Finally, he came to the dermatology department of our hospital and underwent penile lesion tissue biopsy. The pathological report showed that he had penile intraepithelial neoplasia. Considering the large range of lesions, he came to the urological ward for hospitalization and surgical treatment. The patient had no clear history of exposure to chemical properties such as arsenic. His HIV antibody test was negative. He did not have a history of smoking or alcoholism. The lesion was located on the ventral side of the penis and the total area was ~2.2 cm ×2.0 cm (). The surface of the penile lesion was pale red with a gray edge. It had an irregular shape and clear boundaries, and the lesion slightly protruded out of the surface of the skin. There was no obvious exudate on the ulceration, and there was no obvious redness or swelling of the surrounding skin.\nAfter continuous epidural anesthesia, a skin incision line was marked at a 1.0 cm margin from the edge of the lesion of the penis of the patient. The scrotal flap range that needed to be isolated was also set before resectioning of the lesion. We cut the skin of the lesion vertically along the designed incision margin line, deep to the deep fascia layer, and completely resected the lesion tissue on the surface of the deep fascia ().

After radical surgery, he repeatedly received chemoradiotherapy to treat for para-aortic lymph nodes recurrence. Although enlarged abdominal lymph nodes did not disappear completely, further extensive therapy was not performed, and active surveillance was followed for these lymph nodes in consideration of his age and renal function since September 2015. He had no history of malignancy other than ureteral cancer, no breast disease, and no family history of carcinoma. A mass just below the nipple of his right breast was acknowledged in February 2016, and he visited our department in March. On primary clinical examination, a hard 3-cm mass with good mobility was palpated just below the right nipple. Breast ultrasonography (US) revealed an irregular, rough, internally inhomogeneous hypoechoic mass measuring 32 × 35 mm in the center of the right breast right beneath the nipple (Fig. ). A tissue needle biopsy was performed, and histological diagnosis was invasive carcinoma, which showed negative results for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. The mass was 1 cm larger in 1 month. Although the intraductal lesion around the carcinoma was not clear and the tissue similarity to that of the previous ureteral cancer was considered, few findings actively suggested breast metastasis of ureteral cancer, and it was initially diagnosed as a primary breast cancer. The abdominal US showed no liver metastases. Chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed no axillary lymph node enlargement and no distant metastasis, other than the already defined para-aortic lymph nodes enlargement observed in previous CT (Fig. ). Preoperative chemotherapy was taken into consideration, but the patient preferred surgery alone. He underwent a mastectomy and a sentinel lymph node biopsy in April 2016.

During the same period, the patient had several episodes of intermenstrual light vaginal bleedings. She was on oral contraceptive pills for 3 years, and the bleeding and the vaginal discharge did not change with cessation of the pills. She was screened for sexually transmitted diseases by her general practitioner, and the results were normal. Two large loop excisions of the transformation zone for intraepithelial neoplasia had previously taken place. On clinical examination, she was found to have a 50 mm sessile cervical fibroid arising from the posterior wall of the left cervical lip of the cervix. This was confirmed by vaginal ultrasound scanning. The patient was put off uterine artery embolization due to the small risk of ovarian failure and risk of bleeding and infection which could lead to a hysterectomy. Hence, she was advised to consider starting to try and conceive sooner rather than later. Eight weeks later she got pregnant. She had a scan at 7 weeks which confirmed viable intrauterine pregnancy. She had regular antenatal care but experienced recurrent vaginal bleeding throughout the pregnancy due to her cervical fibroids and hence, she had several admissions to the antenatal ward. Her haemoglobin was regularly monitored, and she was placed on prophylactic iron therapy. On one occasion, at 20 weeks gestation, haemoglobin levels had reached 8.4 gm/dL, and 2 units of blood were transfused. The patient was treated conservatively, and a plan of elective caesarean section was agreed on at 39 weeks gestation, but she was aware that this might be brought earlier if she developed heavy bleeding before the agreed on date.

However, the ankle surgery was not arthrodesis.\nDuring physical examination, the patient experienced severe pain with bilateral hip motion. The range of motion of her hip joints were 80 and 80 degrees of flexion, 30 and 30 degrees of abduction 40 and 20 degrees of external rotation, and 0 and 10 degrees of internal rotation for the right and left hip, respectively. Her muscle strength of the paralyzed right hip joint was grade 2 of 5 in hip flexor, 3 of 5 in hip abductor, 3 of 5 in hip adductor, and 2 of 5 in hip extensor.

After 3 days, she started having difficulty in breathing. Chest X-ray showed prominent pulmonary vasculature, and she was treated for congestive heart failure. The next day, she developed some difficulty in swallowing and underwent bedside swallow study, which showed oropharyngeal dysphagia. By the evening, she developed severe neck pain and noticed sudden swelling on the right side of her neck. In view of worsening respiratory distress, urgent computed tomographic of the neck was done, which showed hemorrhage in the thyroid gland with retrosternal extension along with significant deviation and compression of the trachea []. Emergent intubation with Fr 6 endotracheal tube was done and was transferred to our institute for further management.\nOn the presentation, her INR had increased to three, immediately corrected with four units of fresh frozen plasma and was continued on mechanical ventilation with sedation protocol. She was seen by ENT services and underwent biopsy of the thyroid gland to rule out any underlying malignancy. Even with anticoagulant therapy, spontaneous hemorrhage is considered rare, and the presence of underlying malignancy would definitely change her management. Her biopsy specimen showed nodular goiter with bleeding and no evidence of malignancy. Later, she underwent median sternotomy and excision of retrosternal goiter with combined collaboration of ENT and thoracic surgeons.

Due to issues with medication non-adherence the patient subsequently developed bilateral submandibular abscesses and a submental abscess requiring repeat incision and drainage and transition to alternative antibiotics. She had been recently discharged from the hospital four days prior following repeat incision and drainage with the prescriptions for levofloxacin and metronidazole, which she had been taking as instructed. At outpatient follow-up two days after discharge, she reported feeling well and appeared to be clinically improving; she had no symptoms at that time. One day later she developed progressive paranoia and insomnia, and the following day she developed visual hallucinations described as dark shapes. She was then brought to the emergency department by family. Examination was unremarkable with the exception of the psychiatric examination; she showed a flat affect, poor eye contact, and had fluent speech. She appeared internally preoccupied with her hallucinations, and her responses to questions were somewhat limited. According to her family, she had no personal or family history of psychiatric illness and had never had these symptoms previously. Labs on admission included a drug and toxin screen which was negative and a head CT which showed no signs of intracranial pathologies. Other labs showed no evidence of metabolic causes for altered mental status such as hyponatremia, hypernatremia, other electrolyte abnormalities, hypoglycemia, or encephalopathies. Given her lack of psychiatric history and that her symptoms were not consistent with any primary psychiatric disorder or other organic cause, a concern was raised that the condition may have been caused by the antibiotics.

The implantation was surgically revised in 2002 and 2006. In 2014 she noticed hardening and swelling of her right breast. Because of the death of her husband, she did not seek immediate medical attention. She continued to have swelling and increased pain in the right breast. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in January 2016 showed a large fluid collection surrounding the intact right silicone implant as shown in Figure . The case was managed by surgical drainage of fluid collection and capsulectomy. In February 2016, she underwent bilateral prosthesis explantation and bilateral capsulectomy. The pathology demonstrated a 4-cm moderately differentiated invasive SCC. It extended into the muscle, and in situ tumor was noted to extend to the peripheral margin. There was no perineural or lymphovascular invasion. Pathology of the left breast capsule showed chronic inflammation. Computed tomography (CT) of chest, abdomen and pelvis on February 2016 revealed absence of metastatic disease. The patient underwent re-excision of the remaining chest wall mass in March 2016. Pathology showed well differentiated SCC with negative margins. Chest wall fluid was negative for malignant cells. On slide review, it was noted that there was squamous epithelialization of the implant capsule with benign squamous epithelium on both sides. This indicated that the tumor is likely SCC of the implant capsule rather than primary SCC of the breast. Estrogen and progesterone receptor markers were negative as well. Afterwards, she received external beam radiation. She was treated with radiation while supine with free breathing. Four tangent beams were used to target the right breast with 50 Gray in 25 fractions, followed by a 10 Gray boost to the tumor bed delivered in five fractions. Radiation was delivered using opposed tangents completed in May 2016. No adjuvant chemotherapy was offered due to the rare histology and paucity of data.

During this period (> 2 months), the patient went to several local hospitals and received treatment such as external medication, but without any improvement in his symptoms. The erythema further spread to the left side of his face.\nA medical examination was conducted and revealed no abnormalities. Dermatological examination showed clear dark red or purplish red infiltrating patches on the head. They did not completely fade after pressing, with visible exudation and scabs on the surface. The surface of the infiltrating erythema of the left face showed densely distributed vesicles with a little exudation. Mild edema was observed around both eyes, as shown in .\nA head CT scan was performed on May 28th 2019 at the People’s Hospital of Yunyang County.

{"note": "A 69-year-old man presented with severe chest pain and was subsequently diagnosed with extensive anterior wall myocardial infarction. Echocardiography showed akinesia of the anterior septum and anterior wall, and left ventricular ejection fraction was 35%. During admission to the coronary care unit, his blood pressure and urine output were noted to be decreased. Despite inotropic administration, the patient's condition did not improve. Bedside portable echocardiography showed low mitral E velocity and reversed E/A ratio, suggesting volume depletion or dehydration (). Based on Doppler echocardiographic findings, fluid was administered rather than diuretics or volume restriction. After hydration, the patient's condition improved and blood pressure and urine output increased.\nVolume expansion is the first therapeutic measure when a patient presents with hemodynamic instability. However, when the preload of the heart is already high, volume expansion can be hazardous, especially in elderly patients with decreased left ventricular compliance. Because of this concern, despite the need for adequate fluid balance, dehydration in elderly critically ill patients who are admitted to the ICU is not uncommon but usually unrecognized. It is important to avoid hypovolemia in these patients because it can lead to subsequent unexpected complications, such as hypotension and renal failure. Close monitoring is needed in patients being treated with volume expansion because of the delicate balance between excessive pulmonary congestion and reduced preload. Although diuretics are appropriate for the relief of congestion and edema, they are most effective in patients with evidence of fluid retention. In addition, caution should be taken to avoid overdiuresis, which may result in intravascular volume depletion and resultant hypotension or prerenal azotemia. Unlike in patients with grade 2 or 3 diastolic dysfunction (with elevated filling pressures) in whom the addition of diuretics should be considered due to elevated filling pressures, patients with grade 1 diastolic dysfunction (abnormal relaxation) will not benefit from diuretic therapy because their filling pressure is usually not elevated at rest (). Echocardiographic evaluation can identify those patients who would benefit from diuresis. If there is no overt evidence of volume overload,"}

An incisional biopsy was done based on pathologist's recommendation which revealed a highly vascular mass with final pathologic diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst.\nThe best treatment option was deemed to be resection of lesion and due to the size of tumor, total sternectomy was planned.\nAt the time of surgery a longitudinally elliptical midline incision was performed which included previous biopsy site. There was no infiltration or adhesion of mass to skin and subcutaneous tissue and a well-defined, capsulated but highly vascular mass was dissected from surrounding tissues. Due to large dimension of tumor, pectoralis major muscles were pushed laterally to nearly mid clavicular lines (Figures and ). Thoracic cavity was entered with some difficulty in hemostasis on the left side and all attachments of sternum and ribs were cut 2 centimeters away from tumor. The same steps were repeated on the right side. There was minimal adhesion of tumor to right upper lobe that was lysed easily but dense adhesion to anterior part of pericardium was managed by partial resection of pericardium and repairing the pericardium with PTFE mesh.

Taking in account these historical precedents, intravenous antibiotic treatment was administered and a CT of neck and facial area was carried out too. The analysis of the CT showed the presence of an abscess in the corner of the jawbone (left size). The patient was admitted in maxillofacial unit where the surgical drainage of the infectious collection was carried out. From this moment we decided to treat the patient with washed of the infected area every 8 hours and intravenous antibiotic treatment. Consequently, after 7 days the patient was discharged from the hospital with disappearance of the symptomatology and normalizing of analytical parameters. Convinced of our well performance, we were surprised to see the patient consulting again to the emergency service two weeks later.

However, when reviewed in clinic the consultant orthopaedic surgeon noted that there was some calcification around the anterior superior iliac spine which did not collaborate with the time since injury, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed.\nThe imaging reported an abnormality in the anterior right iliac crest with an avulsion fracture and a surrounding soft tissue mass (Fig. ). This solid mass was centred on the anterior superior iliac spine and measured 3 × 4 × 5 cm in size. The signal intensity of this mass was mildly hyperintense on T1-weighted images (Figs. a, ). At the referring hospital, these findings were thought not to correspond to a simple trauma, and suggested a possible underlying bone tumour.\nThe patient was referred to our sarcoma unit for an opinion, where the images were reviewed at a multi-disciplinary meeting. On the review of radiology performed by our specialist musculoskeletal radiologist, it was felt that there was an avulsion fracture of the anterior superior iliac spine with anterolateral displacement of the apophysis and a large surrounding haematoma (Figs. , , ). There was mild enhancing marrow oedema present in the anterior third of the iliac blade, but the signal intensity in the"}

The patient had previously been diagnosed with heart failure and severe aortic insufficiency via transesophageal echocardiography. The patient subsequently planned to undergo reconstruction of the ascending aorta and replacement of the aortic valve.\nOn the day of surgery, the patient was in his usual state of health with no signs of infection. The patient had no musculoskeletal symptoms and had never had shoulder complaints or undergone shoulder surgery. In the operating room, the patient was placed under general anesthesia using propofol as an induction agent and remained supine in a Skytron surgical table for the entirety of the surgery lasting three hours and 36 minutes. The surgery included reconstruction of the ascending aorta and the proximal arch with graft and prosthetic aortic valve replacement, followed by sternal closure with wires and a plate. There were no intraoperative complications and the patient’s mean arterial pressure was maintained at 70 mmHg throughout the surgery. The patient did not suffer any spikes in temperature or have any episodes of increased muscle rigidity.\nTwo days following surgery, the patient complained of bilateral shoulder pain and was unable to raise his arms above his head due to weakness and pain. He denied ever having experienced similar symptoms before. The patient had been restricted to bed rest and was continuously monitored via telemetry on the cardiac floor postoperatively. Upon orthopedic consultation, the patient was afebrile, normotensive, and in no acute distress. The patient’s chest, back, shoulders, and upper extremities displayed no bruising or break in the skin and were soft to palpation. The patient had a full passive range of motion (ROM) but displayed weakness abducting against resistance in the bilateral upper extremities. The patient denied focal tenderness to bilateral upper extremities and sensation was intact to light touch in the distribution of bilateral median, ulnar and radial nerves. The"}
{"note": "The 72 year old male patient was referred to our clinic with the complaint of bilateral axillary masses and numbness in the right hand. In his medical history, he had hypertension for 4 years but no history of trauma. A physical examination showed the presence of palpable pulsatile masses in his both axillae (12 cm in size in the right axilla and 8 cm in size in the left axilla) (Fig. ). His neurological and systemic examinations were within normal limits. An upper-extremity ultrasound examination revealed an aneurysm in a 12-cm segment of the right axillary artery, reaching 67 × 45 mm in dimension. There was a 27-mm thick thrombus at the edge of the aneurysm lumen. Adjacent to the aneurysm, there was a 48 × 40 mm hyperechogenic mass not related to the aneurysm. There was also an aneurysm reaching 40 × 43 mm in dimension in a 9-cm segment of the left axillary artery, with a 17-mm thick thrombus. A Doppler ultrasonic examination revealed a thrombus surrounding the lumen and a turbulent, pulsatile flow in the center. The aneurysmal segment was continuous with the brachial artery. There was no blood flow in the region adjacent to the right axillary artery (Figs. and ). On CT angiography, giant fusiform aneurysms were detected, measuring 140 × 77 mm in the right axillary artery and 93 × 45 mm in the left axillary artery. There were thrombi in both aneurysms, allowing the flow in the lumen. There was also an extension to the brachial artery and contour irregularities at the distal end of the right-side aneurysm. These latter findings were proposed to be due to a spontaneously healed rupture. A physical examination of the eyes, bones, skin and joints revealed no signs of collagen tissue disease, nor was it detected through laboratory examinations. Because the patient was symptomatic and had a high risk of aneurysm rupture, endovascular closure was initially planned. However, appropriate size stents could not be found for aneurysms so large and tortuous. Besides, the"}

Blood sample investigation revealed mild leucocytosis with PRC augmentation and normal AST, ALT and bilirubin levels. Preoperative ultrasound revealed thickened gallbladder wall suggestive of acute cholecystitis. She has had previous sigmoid resection for diverticulitis and ERCP for choledocholithiasis without any mention of biliary abnormality. She was scheduled for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy during which the incidental intraoperative finding of a left sided gallbladder was made. Standard trocar positions were used (A) without any variation of technique, simply following the Strasberg criteria for safe cholecystectomy []. Having seen the anatomical variation (B), a careful dissection of Calot’s triangle was carried out, the cystic duct and artery were identified and isolated, and subsequent complete dissection of the gallbladder from the liver was done (C). This manoeuvre allowed us to demonstrate a right sided positioning of the cystic duct. Furthermore, a safe clipping and transection of the cystic duct and artery was achieved (D), and the gallbladder was extracted in an endobag. The postoperative course was complicated by an aggravation of diabetes and basal pneumonia which were controlled postoperatively in the intensive unit. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 16, in good condition. Retrospective analysis of the clinical case was done and a previous CT scan was reevaluated. Even with the knowledge of a left sided gallbladder, the CT scan was unable to demonstrate its attachment to the left side of the liver. This was probably due to the presence of a hypertrophic left lobe mimicking only a contiguity with the gallbladder, which itself appeared to be in a physiological position (). A vascular and biliary reconstruction was then evaluated with evidence of agenesis of the right anterior sector of the liver () with the absence of the right hepatic duct and an intrahepatic variation with insertion of the right inferior sectorial duct into the left common duct () as type A3 of Huang Classification []."}

The swelling was initially of small size which gradually progressed to the current size. On the basis of clinical finding and radiological report, it was diagnosed as subclavian artery aneurysm and surgical intervention was advised. The patient also had a history of angina 4 months back for which he was hospitalized and treated. He was advised tablet aspirin 75 mg and tablet clopidogrel 75 mg once daily on a regular basis. On local examination, the mass was around 3 cm × 3 cm × 4 cm, diffuse, pulsatile, soft in consistency, and mobile []. Magnetic resonance imaging angiography of the neck showed the aneurysm of subclavian artery, 1 cm lateral to the origin of internal carotid artery []. On two-dimensional echocardiography an ejection fraction of around 30% with mild left ventricular hypokinesia and grade 2 diastolic dysfunction was found. In view of poor cardiac functional status of the patient, RA with CEA was planned as the anesthetic technique. The patient was advised to stop tablet clopidogrel 7 days before the day of surgery. Coagulation profile was done, and it was found to be within the normal limit. Informed and written consent were obtained and the patient was explained about nil per oral. Tablet alprazolam 0.5 mg and tablet ranitidine 150 mg were advised to be taken on the night before and morning on the day of surgery. After taking the patient to the operation theater, all standard ASA monitors were attached and vitals were continuously recorded. Heart Rate was 100/min and electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg, and SpO2 of 99% on room air.

He was previously diagnosed with dysphagia and had undergone PEG. When he was transferred to our hospital, he was still receiving nutritional support through the PEG, without any complications.\nThe first PEG site infection occurred in September 2009. The PEG tube was removed, and a new PEG tube was inserted at another site. He then received enteral feeding through the PEG for 4 years. His body weight was maintained at an appropriate level of 70 kg.\nIn June 2013, the patient stopped responding to verbal commands, but his cognition was intact, and he responded to pain. He could not roll over in bed, or sit up. In addition, new signs of infection were observed around the PEG insertion site. A round swelling and erythematous skin changes with pus-like discharge were seen (). On enhanced abdominal CT, inflammation around the PEG tube was observed (). When leukocytosis and increased levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were confirmed, he was started on intravenous antibiotic therapy. The PEG tube had to be removed; hence, the patient was kept fasting, with peripheral nutritional support. One month after the PEG removal, the complications at the PEG site seemed to have resolved (). The leukocytosis resolved and serum CRP levels normalized, but the patient lost about 3 kg of body weight. A new PEG tube was inserted 2 cm above the previous PEG site (). When he was started on enteral feeding through the new PEG, leakage of gastric contents was observed. The leakage was from the second PEG site. On enhanced abdominal CT, there was a gastrocutaneous fistula around the second PEG insertion site ().

{"note": "A girl aged seven years and eight months was referred to our observation because of left peripheral facial palsy, causing the inability to close the left eye and dropping of the corner of the mouth. A first peripheral facial nerve palsy occurred when she was three years and one month old, with complete regression after corticosteroid treatment. At the age of three years and nine months, she was diagnosed with pure red cell hypoplasia, manifested as severe anaemia (haemoglobin: 3.00 g/dL; red blood cells: 1,000,000/mm3) with an extreme lack of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, but high growth of them in culture, probably caused by anti-EPO antibodies. The detection of anti-EPO antibodies, however, is not routinely performed in a clinical setting. The autoimmune hypothesis was postulated on empirical bases, since haemoglobin levels did not increase after recombinant human EPO administration, but normalized after corticosteroid therapy, and the addition of autologous serum to the erythroid precursor culture inhibited EPO growth. When she was 4 years and 4 months old, the patient presented with a second episode of left facial palsy, combined with the acute onset of a strength deficit on the left side of the body. Mingazzini I and II were positive for the left limbs. The imaging assessment showed a haemorrhagic stroke corresponding to the anterior portion of the right putamen and of the external capsule with perilesional oedema, involving the anterior limb of the internal capsule. Blood pressure measurements performed during the hospitalisation revealed high diastolic blood pressure values. These findings suggest a central rather than peripheral involvement of the facial nerve. Three weeks after their beginning, the symptoms had completely regressed. At the age of five years and six months, a third episode of left peripheral facial palsy occurred. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was repeated, showing gliotic evolution of the previous haemorrhagic insult without new lesions.

{"note": "A 65-year old gentleman, a known case of coronary artery disease and severe left ventricular dysfunction underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation for recurrent shocks from implantable defibrillator due to frequent ventricular tachycardia (VT). The consent for the procedure and for the publication was taken from the patient. The procedure was done using CARTO XP mapping system through retrograde aortic approach. A monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with cycle length 410 ms, right bundle branch block morphology, superior axis of QRS in the frontal plane and positive concordance of QRS in the precordial leads was easily and repeatedly inducible. An activation map of the VT was created in the left ventricle and entrainment was attempted from an area on the anterolateral wall near the mitral annulus. Pacing was performed from the ablation catheter at 380 ms during VT (). There was entrainment with concealed fusion with an identical QRS morphology during pacing with an apparent post pacing interval (PPI) of 290 ms and stimulus to QRS of 330 ms. How can one explain a PPI shorter than the tachycardia cycle length during entrainment with concealed fusion? Radiofrequency ablation at this site resulted in termination of the tachycardia.\nA careful look at the figure reveals that the cycle length of the tachycardia shortens to 380 ms during attempted entrainment with an identical QRS morphology. However, the electrogram in the ablation catheter that is used to measure PPI is present earlier than the pacing stimulus and is not altered during pacing implying that it is a far field signal and not true near field electrogram.[] The large amplitude of this electrogram, possibly due to neighboring anterolateral papillary muscle, in no way excludes the possibility of it being a far field signal. The near field electrogram cannot be made out in the ablation catheter due to artifacts (due to enabling of RF energy) after pacing was stopped. It was not discernible at this site both in the distal and proximal bipole even when the pacing was disabled (not shown) probably because of very"}
{"note": "The patient is a 99-year-old woman, with a vision loss of 70% in the left eye and 40% in the right eye, who underwent basal cell carcinoma resection of the lower right eyelid 3 months before. The resection had an extension of 0.7 × 0.3 cm2, affecting the central margin of the lower eyelid and was treated with direct closure. The hystopathology report of the resection informed solid (nodular) type of basal cell carcinoma characterized by islands of cells with peripheral palisading and disorganized central cells. The margins of resection and the deepest layers were affected.\nAfter the hystopathology report, we decided to plan a more aggressive treatment around the scar of the previous resection. The scar was not well defined (Fig A), so we thought the best approach would be a total resection of the lower eyelid with a full-thickness resection around the scar that would imply a measurement greater than 75% of the full lower eyelid extension.\nWe had a case with 3 limitations for applying the advancement tarsoconjunctival flap: the old age of the patient, the elevated vision loss in the contralateral eye, and the high size of the resection. The patient was advanced in years with a severe vision loss in the contralateral eye, so the occlusion of the right eye and the risk of a second step operation would not be the best options. The defect would be too big for applying this technique. Reviewing the bibliography, we thought this patient could be a good candidate for the total lower eyelid reconstruction with the nasal chondromucosal flap, because it does not need eye occlusion and the reconstruction is achieved with one-step operation.\nBecause of the age of the patient, the operative procedure was performed under local anaesthesia with sedation instead of general anaesthesia. Although this is a large surgical field to perform under local anaesthesia, in our hospital, the final decision about the most suitable anaesthesia depends on the anaesthetist, who considered the local anaesthesia with sedation as the most appropri"}

The patient had diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension and was on immunosuppressive therapy for renal transplantation 8 years prior. Two years prior she had a cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCis) on her left third finger that was excised using MMS. The patient was otherwise healthy on presentation. Physical examination revealed a 1.5 cm eroded erythematous nodule on the left preauricular cheek (). Initial shave biopsy showed an ulcerated neoplasm within the whole dermis extending to all margins of the specimen consisting of multiple irregular islands of atypical cells that stained uniformly with antibodies to pan keratin and uniformly negative with antibodies to S100 protein. A diagnosis of a poorly differentiated carcinoma was made.\nThe tumor was removed with MMS with negative microscopic margins determined by frozen section in one stage resulting in a 3.5 × 2.3 cm defect. Debulked specimen was sent for permanent section revealing a deeply infiltrating primarily undifferentiated carcinoma extending to the subcutaneous fat without evidence of keratinization but with a few foci of duct formation. The neoplasm was connected to and was continuous with the epidermis suggesting that it represents an undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma (). However, due to the presence of ducts, eccrine carcinoma was considered as a potential diagnosis. Three months after resection, the patient presented with a 3 cm ulcerated nodule at the site of the prior excision (). The lesion had rapidly recurred within the incision line one month after surgery, causing pain in her jaw and neck. MMS was performed again with negative microscopic margins after four stages resulting in a 4.0 × 4.0 cm defect.

The mass was painless and gradually increasing in size. The family members of this patient brought her to a traditional healer. They did not seek any medical treatment until late 2017. By this time, the mass over the sacrum was extremely large. Family members claimed the mass was preventing the patient from lying down flat supine. The patient was also unable to ambulate for the past 2 years. Hence, she was bedbound most of the time. It was difficult for her to sit on the wheelchair. She also felt tired to move because the mass was quite heavy. The family members claimed when the patient was lying down flat, she had to flex her hips and knees to achieve a more comfortable position. In addition, she often slept either in prone position or in supine with multiple pillows below her body. The mother also claimed over the last 2 months, the patient’s body had been getting thinner despite her physical weight was increasing due to the increase in size of the sacral mass. The patient had been passing stool and urine in pampers. There was no past medical history and no family history of cancer. Socially, the patient lived with her mother and siblings. The mother was the main care taker. Her father passed away 10 years ago because of heart attack.

The patient reported that approximately 1 week earlier she had endodontic treatment initiated by a general dentist in her left mandibular first molar which had a carious exposure. On the next day after the initiation of endodontic treatment she developed severe pain in the left mandibular first molar and numbness in the left lower lip and chin. On reporting this to her dentist she was prescribed a combination of ofloxacin 200 mg and ornidazole 500 mg every 12 hours and aceclofenac potassium 100 mg and paracetamol 500 mg every 12 hours. The prescribed medication gave her relief from pain but no improvement in the feeling of numbness occurred and therefore her dentist made the referral.\nOn examination with a dental probe, the area of numbness was found, extending from the mandibular midline to the left second premolar both intraorally and extraorally (). There was no deviation in sensory response of gingiva and tongue on probing. The left mandibular first molar showed unremoved proximal carious lesion (DO) and a temporary restoration placed in the access cavity with the tooth in occlusion. Intra-oral periapical radiograph revealed apical periodontal ligament widening in relation to both mesial and distal roots and slight apical root resorption in distal root ().

Physical examination revealed feeble femoral pulses and he was found to be hypertensive with marked differences between the upper and lower limbs (systolic blood pressure upper limb 190mmmHg, lower limb 75 mmHg, with an ankle brachial index (ABI) of 0.39). Electrocardiogram revealed evidence of severe left ventricular hypertrophy. This was confirmed with echocardiography which also demonstrated a tricuspid aortic valve with significant aortic regurgitation in the presence of an aortic root aneurysm of approximately 9 cm. Left ventricular function was preserved. Computerised tomography angiography (CTA) was performed to evaluate the aortic pathology in further detail (Fig. ). The scan noted an aortic root aneurysm (8.8 cm), in addition to the presence of severe aortic coarctation, with subtotal occlusion and a lumen less than 6 mm in size. The coarctation was just distal to the left subclavian artery, at the aortic isthmus. There was clear evidence of collateral circulation to the descending thoracic aorta via the subclavian and intercostal arteries. Coronary angiography confirmed a right dominant coronary system with no significant coronary disease.\nA multidisciplinary team meeting took place and a consensus was agreed to proceed with a two staged hybrid approach, with the first phase involving an endovascular approach to stent the coarctation, followed by a second stage to perform the surgical repair of the aortic root aneurysm. The first stage to stent the coarctation was unsuccessful via the femoral approach, as the guidewire could not cross the coarctation. Assessment through angiography via the left brachial artery showed complete obstruction at the aortic isthmus. The decision was then made to proceed to a single stage surgical approach to treat both lesions.\nAfter induction of anaesthesia, arterial lines were placed in the left radial and left femoral artery.

The boy was apparently alright until 2 years ago when he developed a friendship with a group of boys in school who exhibited mischief, truancy, and bad behavior. Gradually, he developed these behavior resulting in getting punished and having multiple negative remarks in his school calendar. He had physical fights with other students in school and had even injured other students such that they had bleeding after the injury. The school decided that his aggression was excessive and advised him to visit a psychiatrist for an evaluation. He was reluctant to come and was brought forcibly by his mother for a consultation.\nOn detailed assessment, the boy had a normal birth and developmental history.

He was told that the radiographs did not reveal any acute fracture and was advised to rest and to attend at the Orthopaedic Surgery Specialist Outpatient Clinic 2 weeks later. The patient felt symptomatically better after a few days and had returned to running and playing field hockey. Three weeks from the initial injury, there was recurrence of pain and swelling in the left great toe and this was limiting the function of the patient. This prompted him to seek attention at our Specialist Outpatient Clinic.\nOn examination, the affected big toe was shortened and dorsally dislocated as compared with the contralateral side. There was tenderness and swelling at the IP joint. While walking, the plantar side of the great toe did not touch the floor. There was lack of active movement of the affected IP joint. The IP joint could not be maneuvered passively too. Normal motion was maintained over the left metatarsophalangeal joint. Plain radiography was repeated and showed obliquity of the IP joint line with an interposed sesamoid bone (). Dislocation of the IP joint of the left big toe was suspected based on the clinical presentation as well as subtle features appreciable on the radiographs as discussed with our radiologists.

The patient was a weak debilitated woman, residing in an assisted living facility with a Karnofsky Performance Index of 40 (disabled, requires special care and help). Her past medical history was significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation needing oral Coumadin. On examination in the emergency room, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits, and the only history provided was the patient had not passed urine for a day by the patient's care provider. Clinical examination was positive for a mass palpable in the abdomen which was globular and firm in consistency. A routine set of blood work at the time was remarkable for anemia with a hemoglobin of 6 g/dL and an elevated INR to 4.5. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and the pelvis at the time of admission with intravenous contrast revealed a large grade 3 RSH extending into the pelvis and causing compressive symptoms over the bladder outlet (Figures , ). There was no evidence of contrast extravasation in the hematoma. The patient was immediately transfused packed red blood cells to maintain a hemoglobin of more than 8 g/dL. Coumadin was held and INR reversed with the help of fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K. The patient had a Foley catheter placed to relieve bladder outlet obstruction. Over the subsequent day, the patient continued to have stable hemoglobin and make urine. In view of the patient’s poor performance index and high risk for surgery, a 14 French catheter was placed in the hematoma. Over the subsequent days, clinical examination revealed a reduction in the size of the abdominal hematoma and the Foley catheter was removed on four days post procedure.

The pain became severe when he bent his waist, and an paresthesia was found with a numbness going to the tip of the right middle toe. The physical examination showed a positive finding in the straight leg raising test (20 degree/60 degree). The lumbosacral plain film showed that the disc space between L4 and L5 was narrow. The patient had no particular history. The patient's pain was not relieved but continued even after a caudal epidural steroid injection as well as after interlaminar epidural steroid injections given at one week intervals. Because the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a central herniated lumbar disc between L4 and L5 and compression of the right L5 nerve root, we decided to perform ELND.\nThe patient was hospitalized one day before the operation, and provided written informed consent. He started fasting eight hours before the operation and showed nothing unusual in the preoperative blood test. On the day of the operation, cefazolin 1 g was intravenously injected one hour before the beginning of the operation for the purpose of preventing an operation related infection. The patient was put into the prone position on the surgical table after arriving at the operating room. The position was adjusted with a Wilson frame and a pillow at the abdomen so that lumbar flexion could be unfolded and the upper body could be a little bit higher than the lower body. Afterwards, a wide area around the sacral hiatus was disinfected with aseptic technique. Local anesthesia was performed in the region to be operated on with 1% mepivacaine.

She had a history of a prior cesarean delivery for arrest of active labor at 7 cm and after extensive counseling chose to undergo a TOLAC. The initial cervical exam was 2 cm dilation and 50% effacement. Her labor was induced with oxytocin and amniotomy was performed at 5 cm dilation with clear fluid noted. She progressed from 2 cm to 5 cm over the course of 10 hours; interval time to progression to 6 cm was 3.5 hours. The patient then began to have a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding with associated minimal fetal heart rate variability and variable decelerations that did not improve with intrauterine resuscitation. She was taken to the operating room for repeat cesarean delivery due to concern for a uterine rupture and/or a placental abruption. Upon entry into the abdomen, there was no uterine rupture or dehiscence, nor was there evidence of a significant placental abruption. She delivered a male infant with a weight of 2659 g and Apgar scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively; arterial cord pH was 7.26. No extension of the hysterotomy was noted following delivery of the infant. Following repair of the hysterotomy, the bladder was noted to be distended and edematous, despite the presence of a patent Foley catheter. This finding prompted a vaginal exam to assist in evaluating the integrity of the lower uterine segment behind the bladder due to concern for an occult uterine rupture or dehiscence. The vaginal exam revealed a spontaneous detachment of the anterior rim of the cervix from approximately 9 to 3 o'clock. The avulsed portion of cervix appeared necrotic () and there was no bleeding noted at the site of cervical detachment.

We found a lung mass that surrounds the left lower lobar bronchus, multiple peripheral lung masses, and the lymph node enlargements of the mediastinal areas from the chest computed tomography (). On both sides of her lower neck, multiple lymph nodes were palpable. The routine laboratory findings were not remarkable.\nShe had a history of total hysterectomy for uterine MMMT () one and a half years ago. Multiple pelvic lymph node enlargements were found 6 months later and a recurrence of MMMT was confirmed by surgical biopsy. At that time, there was no small cell carcinoma component in uterine cancer pathologically. No further treatment for MMMT was given to her. Based on her past history, we initially suspected lung and femur metastases of MMMT. The protruding mass lesion on the orifice of the left lower lobe basal segment was found and biopsied by the bronchoscopy. However, the pathologic features of this mass was the typical small cell lung carcinoma () rather than metastatic MMMT from uterus. We assumed that all of these findings are attributable to small cell lung cancer, and we started the treatment accordingly. She was treated with etoposide plus cisplatin. Radiation was delivered to her femur for palliation of pain. After 2 cycles of chemotherapy, most lesions that were located relatively central (mediastinal lymph nodes and the mass around the left lower lobar bronchus) slightly decreased, but the most of peripheral masses increased (). In the meantime, she had to undergo hemiarthroplasty"}

There was no history of pain or swelling. On clinical examination, it was found that the patient had a traumatic injury in relation to the right maxillary lateral incisor (tooth # 12) with an extensive fracture involving the entire crown (Ellis Class III fracture). The pulp was exposed and there was extensive loss of tooth structure with only about 3 mm of crown remaining []. There was no other evidence of injury to the periodontal ligament or alveolar bone. The tooth exhibited normal physiologic mobility. The pulpal exposure was more than 2 mm in diameter. The intraoral periapical radiograph revealed an immature root with blunderbuss apex []. The parents were explained the consequences of tooth extraction. The parents were very apprehensive about tooth extraction at an early age so it was decided to avoid tooth extraction and maintain pulp vitality by performing laser pulpotomy followed by prosthetic rehabilitation after completion of root formation. After an informed consent, it was decided to use a diode laser (940 nm, Ezlase, Biolase Technology Inc. USA) for the pulpal amputation. After administering local anesthesia, access cavity was prepared on tooth #12 using outward brush strokes of the bur to avoid further pulpal damage by laceration. A 400 nm focused tip was used after activation in pulsed mode at 2.0 W. Pulse length and pulse interval were set for 0.50 μs. The procedure was performed under standard aseptic conditions and recommended laser protection methods. The tip was moved in a contact mode just around the periphery of the exposed pulp so as to remove the coronal pulp without any damage to the underlying radicular pulp. Multiple applications of the laser energy were administered to ablate the pulp and achieve hemostasis. A sterile hemostatic pulp cap [] was"}

She has had previous sigmoid resection for diverticulitis and ERCP for choledocholithiasis without any mention of biliary abnormality. She was scheduled for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy during which the incidental intraoperative finding of a left sided gallbladder was made. Standard trocar positions were used (A) without any variation of technique, simply following the Strasberg criteria for safe cholecystectomy []. Having seen the anatomical variation (B), a careful dissection of Calot’s triangle was carried out, the cystic duct and artery were identified and isolated, and subsequent complete dissection of the gallbladder from the liver was done (C). This manoeuvre allowed us to demonstrate a right sided positioning of the cystic duct. Furthermore, a safe clipping and transection of the cystic duct and artery was achieved (D), and the gallbladder was extracted in an endobag. The postoperative course was complicated by an aggravation of diabetes and basal pneumonia which were controlled postoperatively in the intensive unit. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 16, in good condition. Retrospective analysis of the clinical case was done and a previous CT scan was reevaluated. Even with the knowledge of a left sided gallbladder, the CT scan was unable to demonstrate its attachment to the left side of the liver. This was probably due to the presence of a hypertrophic left lobe mimicking only a contiguity with the gallbladder, which itself appeared to be in a physiological position ().

{"note": "A 72-year-old man was referred to our hospital due to unstable angina and dyspnea. The symptoms initiated a few hours before, and his medical background consisted of hypertension. The clinical examination revealed significant edema of both lower extremities, and there were no specific abnormalities at the electrocardiogram. The heart echo showed normal systole of the left ventricle with ejection fraction 65%, no pathological findings as regards the function of the heart valves, and increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) which was estimated 55 mmHg while the volume of the right ventricle was 105 ml. As the angina persisted, the patient was submitted to a coronary angiography. The examination revealed a fistula between the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and pulmonary artery (PA) and in proximity to this a distal severe stenosis of the LAD (approximately 80%) (). Moreover, a significant stenosis (70%) at the ostium of obtuse marginal artery (OM) was detected.\nA coronary CT angiography was performed in order to verify this finding and to obtain more specific information (). At this point, it should be mentioned that the options examined were two, the surgical approach and the percutaneous transcatheter intervention. The percutaneous intervention could be performed with the deployment of a large stent on the LAD in order to treat the stenotic lesion and at the same time cover the fistula's ostium, as reported in the literature [], or the placement of vascular plug. After assessment of this information and shared decision-making of the heart team of our hospital, a surgical intervention was decided in the thought that multiple vessels had to be revascularized, acute events during the percutaneous intervention were possible, and a permanent solution would be the best option as the patient's physical status permitted an open surgery.\nThe patient was submitted to a typical median sternotomy with aortic and atrial cannulation. After harvesting the grafts (left internal mammary (LIMA) and saphenous vein (SVG)), we proceeded with pump procedure. The fistula between the LAD and PA approximately 5 cm was identified, and"}

He had undergone repair of his cleft lip and of his cleft palate at the age of 6 and 14 months respectively and his medical history was unremarkable and he was born following full term pregnancy and a normal delivery.\nAt the age of 8 year deciduous teeth were extracted under a short general anesthetic. Both right and left maxillary canines were present in the arch as he had extensive orthodontic treatment in the past to allow eruption. Radiographs showed absence of the maxillary right central and lateral incisors, which had been extracted due to increased mobility (grade III) following infection.\nThe maxilla was composed of a lesser (right) and a larger (left) segment with a wide maxillary cleft [Figure and ]. As the right canine was not fully erupted, a total space of 15 mm was measured from mesial surface of the upper right first premolar to mesial of upper left central incisor. The former segment had undergone orthodontic expansion in 2005 in order to move to a more buccal position. An oro-nasal fistula was present.\nA secondary alveolar bone grafting procedure was initially declined due to the cleft size and a decision was taken for pre-grafting orthodontics and a segmental distraction approach in order to mobilize the lesser maxillary segment anteriorly to minimize the gap. One year of orthodontic treatment did achieve alignment of the maxillary teeth [Figure and ] and most importantly a 3 mm initial space between the 1st molar and the 2nd premolar in order to minimize risk of dental root injury during the surgery.\nUnder general anesthesia the right maxillary alveolar bony segment was exposed by a high maxillary sulcus incision, while the attached gingiva covering the crest of the ridge from the maxillary right 1st molar up to the right canine were not reflected"}

The complaint was preceded by a hoarse voice since 5 months ago. Endoscopic examination of the larynx showed a mass of laryngeal papillomas that filled the larynx so that the airway became narrow. Patients diagnosed with pediatric laryngeal papilloma type and upper airway obstruction. Patients undergo tracheotomy and proceed with microscopic laryngeal surgery to clear the papilloma mass.\nPatients undergo papilloma cleansing surgery every 2 to 4 months. The patients who live outside the city and far from the health center that capable of performing laryngeal surgery cause patients to repeatedly experience upper airway obstruction so that they undergo a repeated tracheotomy. It was obtained a history by one of the patient that has undergone tracheotomy 4 times due to repeated upper airway obstruction. Until the age of 25 years, patients have undergone surgery 88 times already. The frequency of surgery does not decrease even though the patient has reached adulthood. Papilloma of the trachea began to spread to the bronchi since the age of 12 years so that the tracheocele was maintained from 1992 until now.\nRepeated surgery causes stenosis in the larynx () so that the tracheocele is maintained. Another benefit of maintaining tracheoculosis is that it facilitates bronchoscopy when cleaning papillomas in the trachea-bronchi. A final endoscopic examination shows papilloma implantation in the trachea to the proximal right main bronchi (). HPV virus examination by the PCR method showed that the presence of HPV type 11 infection in patients with papilloma preparations ().\nHistopathological examination of papilloma tissue was revealed the squamous epithelium coated with papilloma with moderate dysplasia and epithelium that appeared to be koilocytosis ().

After a triplet pregnancy achieved through an in vitro fertilization embryo transfer in a private clinic, the patient underwent a McDonald operation at 16 weeks gestation due to the risk of preterm birth in multiple gestations. The patient then presented to the emergency department of our hospital at 30 weeks and 2 days gestation due to premature rupture of membranes. She was prepared for an urgent Caesarean section at 31 weeks and 3 days gestation due to sudden contractions. In a seated position, the patient underwent a midline approach to the L3-4 interspinous space using an 18 G Tuohy needle. Cerebrospinal fluid leaked while identifying the epidural space using the loss of resistance (LOR) technique with 2.5 mL of air. Dural puncture was suspected, and the needle was removed. As a result, the initially scheduled epidural anesthesia was changed to spinal anesthesia. Subsequently, we successfully initiated spinal anesthesia using a 26 G Quincke needle in the same location. The patient was move to a supine position after administering 10 mg of bupivacaine. The Caesarean section was initiated after confirmation of adequate anesthesia up to the fourth thoracic segment. All three babies and the placenta were delivered. All vital signs were stable before and after the anesthetic injection, and no abnormal findings were observed at the time of the procedure. The patient was advised postoperative bed rest and began early ambulation on the first postoperative day. Since the patient complained of mild tinnitus during ambulation without any other associated symptoms, closer follow-up was initiated.\nOn the second postoperative day, she complained of headache, nausea, and other symptoms, and she began complaining of a stiff neck and vomiting on the third postoperative day.

Upon arrival she was nonambulatory with physical exam findings suggestive of lateral patella dislocation. The patella was palpated laterally and the knee locked at 20 degrees of flexion, with pain at any attempt at motion of the knee. Further exam revealed no other signs of global joint or soft tissue laxity. She did not endorse any signs or symptoms of previous patellar subluxation, instability, or hypermobility. Plain radiographs were obtained in the emergency department confirming the diagnosis of a lateral patellar dislocation with a 9 mm avulsion fracture of anterior medial border of the patella (Figures and ).\nUtilizing intraarticular local anesthetic injection as well as intravenous analgesia and conscious sedation, multiple attempts at closed reduction were made in the emergency room. Maneuvers with flexion, extension, and manual manipulation of the patella were unsuccessful in reducing the patella. This was followed by the use of bone reduction forceps in a percutaneous manner under sterile conditions to attempt to more directly manipulate the patella; however this too was unsuccessful. The patient was subsequently taken to the operative room that day where a closed reduction was attempted, now with complete muscle relaxation under the control of general anesthesia, and again no successful reduction could be obtained in a closed manner. A 2 cm incision along the lateral border of the patella was made where manual exploration revealed that the patella was incarcerated in the lateral patellar retinaculum and locked against the lateral femoral condyle. Reduction of the patella was completed with minimal effort after release of the incarcerated lateral tissues. Next, the incision was closed and a diagnostic arthroscopy was performed demonstrating trauma to the lateral femoral condyle and an 11 mm free floating chondral fragment identified in the medial gutter.

In the first episode in 2010 he had osteomyelitis involvement of only the outer table of calvarium. Adequate surgical excision was done, however, he did not comply with antimicrobial therapy and lost from follow up. The second episode was in the same site which suggests that it was a relapse rather than reinfection. This time lesion penetrated the inner table with extension to epidural space. Fortunately, there was no brain parenchymal involvement. No other focus of involvement with actinomycosis infection was identified in our patient.\nIn the case series reported by Smego et al., out of 70 patient with CNS actinomycosis only one patient had relapse []. This patient had temporal lobe abscess treated with needle aspiration followed by antibiotics, duration was not specified. He had relapse of actinomycosis as multiple brain abscess after 29 months. Relapse of actinomycosis have been described in many scenarios, all due to inadequate duration of antimicrobial therapy [, , , ]. Review of the cases reported before and our case indicate that Actinomycosis of the skull is a disease of young, immunocompetent patients. The presentation is usually insidious. Intracranial extension is common with some patients presenting with neurologic deficits. Imaging especially CT scan or MRI are very valuable to identify the lesion, however culture and histopathology are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The mainstay of management for actinomycosis is medical therapy [], with surgical drainage indicated if the collection is large or to establish a diagnosis. Penicillin is the drug of choice. Patients with actinomycosis require prolonged (6- to 12-month) antimicrobial treatment with high doses of penicillin G or amoxicillin.

The patient mentioned that the mass appeared suddenly with no history of trauma and that she was concerned about the potential malignant nature of the mass. The patient also mentioned that she underwent incision and drainage of that mass 2 months after its appearance with no improvement and provided no detailed surgical or pathological reports, which was the reason for her delayed presentation. Upon her assessment, the mass was located over the ulnar side of the proximal phalanx of left ring finger with extensive involvement of the 4th web space. The overlying skin coverage was ulcerative with no active signs of infection. Range of motion of the involved digit was limited, however neurovascular examination was normal. ().\nRadiological evaluation of the involved hand showed a soft tissue swelling with no evidence of bone involvement (). Further magnetic resonant (MRI) evaluation showed a mass on the volar aspect of the ring finger encasing about 50% of the flexor tendons of that digit with low signal intensity on T1 and high signal intensity on T2 evaluation with strong enhancement in post contrast evaluation. Assessment of neurovascular structures showed partial abutment of the radial sided bundle together with complete encirclement of the ulnar sided neurovascular bundle. The surrounding bone was free of any masses and associated mass effect.\nThe patient was taken to the OR for exploration and mass excision by the senior author. Possible risks associated with such intervention were explained. Intra-operatively, bruner type incision was designed together with island of skin involved in the mass.

The patient shows a high risk for caries and also eccentric bruxism. He has partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant and multiple decay and fractured teeth. The initial approach was conservative aiming to keep the upper front by means of composite fillings (Figures and ). Then, the posterior superior quadrants needed to be restored with implants.\nThree years after, in 2017, the patient came back to the office referring pain of endodontic origin in the upper left canine. New and secondary subgingival caries were found in the six front teeth. The conservative prognosis was considered poor due to the subgingival depth and extent of decay presented by the lesions from canine to canine. After having discussed the treatment options, especially the surgical lengthening of the front teeth or the orthodontic extrusion, the patient decides to replace the residual teeth with a new implant-supported bridge similar to the recently performed prostheses of the posterior areas that were judged by him as a highly satisfactory treatment. The patient preferred not to involve these restorations in the present anterior treatment and limited it to place only two implants in the lateral incisors' positions ().\nThe treatment was carried out in a staged approach. Briefly, first, we extracted the lateral incisors, using the SST, and placed two immediate implants. The four residual teeth were then prepared to be used as abutments of a temporary bridge for the purpose of maintaining the aesthetics and function of the patient during the early osseointegration period. In a further step, the four remaining teeth were also extracted using the SST, and the initial provisional bridge was replaced by the second provisional screwed on the uncovered implants. Only one out of the four abutment teeth used for the temporization of root canal treatment was needed due to a periapical infection.\nWhen placing the two"}

Biochemical tests demonstrated slow increase of cancer antigen CA 125 levels (74.2 U/mL—units per millilitre), whereas all the other tests (including tumoral markers, urinary and liver tests) were normal. The upper digestive endoscopy raised suspicion of an extrinsic compression of the medial third of the esophagus (at 26 cm from the dental arcade), which did not allow performing the maneuver with a 10 mm endoscope. The stenosis was hardly crossed by using a pediatric 5 mm endoscope, which showed the extension of the affected area on 5 cm. A gastrostomy feeding tube was placed during endoscopy. However, the esophageal lining was normal on the entire surface, again raising suspicion of extrinsic compression ().\nIn this context, an endoscopic ultrasound was attempted to retrieve a biopsy, but the maneuver was unsuccessful due to the extreme compression of the esophagus. The patient later underwent thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic computed tomography that demonstrated the presence of suspect pulmonary nodules in association with a mass compressing the esophagus and invading the pleura, the pericardium, the esophageal wall, and the aortic wall ( and ), as well as a tumoral nodule in close proximity to the uterine cervix invading the right ureter and creating an ureteral stenosis.

His neurological and systemic examinations were within normal limits. An upper-extremity ultrasound examination revealed an aneurysm in a 12-cm segment of the right axillary artery, reaching 67 × 45 mm in dimension. There was a 27-mm thick thrombus at the edge of the aneurysm lumen. Adjacent to the aneurysm, there was a 48 × 40 mm hyperechogenic mass not related to the aneurysm. There was also an aneurysm reaching 40 × 43 mm in dimension in a 9-cm segment of the left axillary artery, with a 17-mm thick thrombus. A Doppler ultrasonic examination revealed a thrombus surrounding the lumen and a turbulent, pulsatile flow in the center. The aneurysmal segment was continuous with the brachial artery. There was no blood flow in the region adjacent to the right axillary artery (Figs. and ). On CT angiography, giant fusiform aneurysms were detected, measuring 140 × 77 mm in the right axillary artery and 93 × 45 mm in the left axillary artery. There were thrombi in both aneurysms, allowing the flow in the lumen. There was also an extension to the brachial artery and contour irregularities at the distal end of the right-side aneurysm. These latter findings were proposed to be due to a spontaneously healed rupture. A physical examination of the eyes, bones, skin and joints revealed no signs of collagen tissue disease, nor was it detected through laboratory examinations.

He had a right parietal VPS in place; shunt series X-rays showed no shunt disconnections. In addition, abdominal X-rays demonstrated a retained peritoneal distal catheter from his previous shunt revision operations. Given the concerns for shunt failure, he underwent shunt exploration and revision for management. During the shunt revision surgery, the valve was found to be nonfunctional and was replaced; the retained peritoneal distal catheter was also removed laparoscopically by the general surgery team. His initial postoperative course was uncomplicated, and he was discharged on postoperative day 1 with decrease in his headaches and improvement in his subjective complaint of blurry vision.\nHe again presented 17 months later with continual headaches, decrease in vision, and increased ventricular size.

She had suffered with recurrent urinary tract infections for most of her childhood and adult life but was otherwise well with no other major co-morbidities or risk factors for colorectal malignancy and had no family history of colorectal disease.\nColonoscopy revealed two large sessile polyps in the sigmoid colon in close proximity to each other and adjacent to a diverticulum-like structure (Fig. ). Each polyp was approximately 3 cm in size and both exhibited a type IV pit pattern with areas of irregularity suggestive of focally advanced disease. Histological examination confirmed both polyps were adenomas comprising both low and high grade dysplasia, without submucosal invasion (Fig. ). On closer inspection the mucosa around the diverticulum was also atypical but not adenomatous. The remainder of the colonoscopy was unremarkable with no other evidence of diverticular disease or polyps elsewhere.\nEndoscopic resection was considered as a therapeutic option however in view of the above characteristics as well as difficult endoscopic access surgery was preferred. Furthermore, radiological imaging had initially raised the possibility of invasive disease in view of sigmoid thickening.

The scan noted an aortic root aneurysm (8.8 cm), in addition to the presence of severe aortic coarctation, with subtotal occlusion and a lumen less than 6 mm in size. The coarctation was just distal to the left subclavian artery, at the aortic isthmus. There was clear evidence of collateral circulation to the descending thoracic aorta via the subclavian and intercostal arteries. Coronary angiography confirmed a right dominant coronary system with no significant coronary disease.\nA multidisciplinary team meeting took place and a consensus was agreed to proceed with a two staged hybrid approach, with the first phase involving an endovascular approach to stent the coarctation, followed by a second stage to perform the surgical repair of the aortic root aneurysm. The first stage to stent the coarctation was unsuccessful via the femoral approach, as the guidewire could not cross the coarctation. Assessment through angiography via the left brachial artery showed complete obstruction at the aortic isthmus. The decision was then made to proceed to a single stage surgical approach to treat both lesions.\nAfter induction of anaesthesia, arterial lines were placed in the left radial and left femoral artery. A right infraclavicular incision and a right groin incision was made this was to establish peripheral arterial cannulation access to the right axillary and right femoral artery. An 8 mm dacron"}

At 10 weeks postoperatively, radiographs demonstrated breakage of the superior portion of the cerclage wire (). Although he was advised to have all fixation devices removed after fracture healing and continuous follow-up, the patient was lost to follow-up after a clinical examination and plain radiography at 16 weeks postoperatively because he had no symptoms such as irritation due to the wire or limitation of range of motion. At 16 weeks, the wire was still radiographically at the superior part of the right patella.\nThe patient returned to our outpatient clinic 2 years after the surgery because the wire had perforated the skin anteriorly. He did not recall any trauma to the knee since the last follow-up. Radiographs of the right knee demonstrated that the cerclage wire was broken into pieces, and a fragment had migrated into the posterior compartment (). We could not decide from plain radiographs or three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) whether the wire fragment was in the posterior compartment of the knee joint or the popliteal fossa (). Because there was a risk of chondral damage if it was inside the joint or neurovascular damage if it was in the popliteal fossa, the patient agreed to surgery to remove the hardware.\nA skin incision was made anteriorly over the previous incision and all the wires were removed. An arthroscopic examination was then performed; before scoping the posterior compartment, we performed the routine arthroscopic assessment through the standard anteromedial portal. Any structural damage including chondral lesion due to the wire migration was not found. Then, we examined the posterior compartment through the posteromedial or posterolateral portal. However, we could not find the wire fragment by palpating with a probe.

The patient shows a high risk for caries and also eccentric bruxism. He has partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant and multiple decay and fractured teeth. The initial approach was conservative aiming to keep the upper front by means of composite fillings (Figures and ). Then, the posterior superior quadrants needed to be restored with implants.\nThree years after, in 2017, the patient came back to the office referring pain of endodontic origin in the upper left canine. New and secondary subgingival caries were found in the six front teeth. The conservative prognosis was considered poor due to the subgingival depth and extent of decay presented by the lesions from canine to canine. After having discussed the treatment options, especially the surgical lengthening of the front teeth or the orthodontic extrusion, the patient decides to replace the residual teeth with a new implant-supported bridge similar to the recently performed prostheses of the posterior areas that were judged by him as a highly satisfactory treatment. The patient preferred not to involve these restorations in the present anterior treatment and limited it to place only two implants in the lateral incisors' positions ().\nThe treatment was carried out in a staged approach. Briefly, first, we extracted the lateral incisors, using the SST, and placed two immediate implants. The four residual teeth were then prepared to be used as abutments of a temporary bridge for the purpose of maintaining the aesthetics and function of the patient during the early osseointegration period. In a further step, the four remaining teeth were also extracted using the SST, and the initial provisional bridge was replaced by the second provisional screwed on the uncovered implants.

{"note": "We were offered a left cadaveric kidney from a 69-year-old female, retrieved by a different unit in the country. The cause of brain death was a large intracerebral haemorrhage. The donor was known to have hypertension that was well controlled with co-amiloride, a normal kidney function and no other significant medical history. On retrieval, the left kidney was found to have one artery and two veins.\nWhile preparing the kidney prior to transplantation, we found a 1.5 cm, saccular, thin walled aneurysm close to the hilum of the kidney that had not been noticed during retrieval (). The aneurysm was located at the branch point of the renal artery into multiple small branches; these were all aneurysmal as well. It was deemed surgically impossible to reconstruct all of these aneurysmal vessels and hence the kidney was not used for the purpose of transplantation. As there was consent for the purpose of research, the aneurysmal segment was excised and sent for histopathology and the kidney was sent for research purposes.\nThe histology of the aneurysmal segment revealed marked thinning of the arterial wall with widespread fragmentation and loss of elastic fibres in the tunica media, with increased amounts of mucopolysaccharide matrix material (so-called cystic medial degeneration). The right kidney from the same donor had normal anatomy and was successfully transplanted in another unit.\nThe aetiology of these aneurysms is unclear, although they appear to be related to arterial fibrodysplasia that is exaggerated at the branch points in the renal vasculature due to discontinuities in the internal elastic lamina at these points []; in our case ‘cystic medial degeneration’ was found on histological examination. The risk of rupture is low, but it carries a mortality rate of up to 80% [,]. There are case reports of laparoscopic nephrectomy and ex vivo repair of simple renal artery aneurysms in live related transplants [].\nOur aim is to raise awareness of this uncommon condition, among retrieval and transplant teams, especially in cadaveric and non-heartbeating kidneys, where it can be often"}

She had undergone five attempts of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and hormonal therapy previous to this pregnancy. The gestation had been without pathological findings to this point and the family history of the woman did not show any malignant tumors. The first medical consultation due to the swelling was in the 6th month at her general practitioner, who performed a sonography and advised an MRI scan. This was finally done at the 11th july 2012 which showed a hyperintense mass of 6,7 cm × 4,7 cm × 3,8 cm surrounding the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle. The X-ray of the knee was without any pathological findings.\nThe first presentation in our clinic for musculoskeletal tumors was 7 weeks before the calculated delivery date. The clinical examination showed a firm mass at the lateral back of the right lower leg, 10 cm in length from the popliteal fossa to distal (see Figures and ) adherent to the underlying muscles. The flexion of the knee was limited to 100°. The peripheral blood circulation and sensibility were intact at the day of presentation, but the patient described electric paresthesias occurring from time to time radiating from the knee along the lateral leg to the foot.\nThe results of anamneses and clinical examination and MRI diagnostic and the differential diagnosis were discussed with the patient and further treatment was planned. We recommended an open biopsy due to the close anatomic relation to the tibial and common peroneal nerve which could cause complications within a fine needle biopsy. We decided to observe the tumor and perform the open biopsy one week after the delivery (which was a secondary caesarean section) at the 09th August 2012.

On initial physical examination her weight was in 90th percentile, length in the 75th percentile. Her right cheek was slightly fuller than left cheek. The right arm and forearm were thicker than counterparts on the left. The right leg was thicker and measured approximately 2 cm longer than left leg. We noticed a right sided complex hemihyperplasia (, ) as well as a right-sided abdominal mass of 10 cm dia-meter. Her blood pressure and other vital signs were normal. A detailed medical history showed that the mother first noticed the asymmetry of her legs when she was three months old and took her to a pediatrician. The physician's presumptive diagnosis was congenital hip dislocation. Therefore a hip ultrasonography (US) was performed which showed no evidence of hip dislocation. An orthopedic surgeon was consulted, who ruled out a hip problem. Then the family was told it was something constitutional and no other recommendation was made. The infant was otherwise healthy during the following months, however the family noticed that the cheeks were also growing asymmetric but they took no other action since they were told it was constitutional and would do no harm to the child. The family history was unremarkable and she was the first and only child of the parents who was born weighing 3.5 kg after an uneventful pregnancy.\nAt the age of 12 months, when she developed macroscopic hematuria, an abdominal US showed a right sided renal mass. The patient was then referred to our hospital for further investigation and management. A renal mass and hematuria in an infant with isolated hemihyperplasia strongly suggested a Wilms’ tumor. An abdominal US and a computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a cystic/solid mass of 10 cm in diameter at the right kidney consistent with Wilms tumor ().

His medical history was significant for dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease due to chronic allograft nephropathy despite cyclosporine therapy for a living-related donor kidney transplant. He suffered a previous myocardial infarction treated with percutaneous coronary intervention and sick sinus syndrome, which required a pacemaker that was removed due to a postoperative abscess. He survived squamous cell carcinoma of the parotid gland with lymphatic involvement that necessitated radical resection and radiation of the head, neck, and axilla. He was also diabetic. At the time of his initial presentation to our clinic, his symptoms included very slight loss of coordination in his left hand and a mild sense of imbalance. He could still ambulate and live independently and therefore did not wish to proceed with cervical decompression and fusion.\nHe was lost to follow-up but returned to our clinic two years later. At this time, he presented with loss of coordination in both hands and could no longer ambulate. As a result, he was no longer able to care for himself. He remained dialysis dependent and was oliguric, but not completely anuric. Repeat cervical MRI revealed worsening stenosis at C3-5 compared to the MRI scan performed two years earlier. At this point, he wished to proceed with surgery. As per standard protocol, he was given 1 gram of intravenous cefazolin immediately prior to incision. He underwent posterior C3-5 laminectomies and instrumented fusion with lateral mass fixation. In an attempt to preserve his remaining kidney function and reduce his risk of SSI, we applied 1 gram of vancomycin powder over the instrumentation and soft tissues of the surgical exposure. Although there were not any previous reports of intrawound application of vancomycin powder in patients on dialysis, we felt it was a justified treatment to minimize his chance of SSI given his multiple risk factors for a postoperative infection.\nA serum vancomycin level six hours after surgery was 0."}

After initial assessment and debridement in the operating room, he was brought to the general systems intensive care unit (ICU) for acute renal failure likely due to myoglobulinuria. He remained in the ICU for 34 days until he was transferred to the burn unit. Several operations including multiple debridements and allograft applications were performed throughout his time in the ICU and burn unit. During his extended stay, he was treated for many complications, including multiple infections, pancreatitis, deep vein thrombosis, pleural effusion, cardiomyopathy, chronic diarrhea, depression, as well as upper airway and upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding secondary to ulcers. As well, he developed another acute kidney injury thought to be secondary to acute tubular necrosis and had multiple instances of elevated liver enzymes and abnormal liver function tests. Both of these organ insults were thought to be secondary to medications administered, as these values corrected with discontinuation of these insulting agents. In total, his acute care admission lasted approximately 15 months with 33 operations/procedures needed before he could be transferred to a rehabilitation unit.\nThroughout his prolonged stay, he was worked up for anemia as he required massive amounts of RBC transfusions to maintain an average hemoglobin value over his admission of 95 g/L. This value fluctuated regularly falling into the low 70s on many occasions necessitating the use of blood products. Multiple gastrointestinal bleeds presenting with melena were thought to be large contributors to this laboratory abnormality. The question of hemolysis was raised as early on in his treatment course; he occasionally had elevated lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin values, as well as positive direct antiglobulin tests. However, his haptoglobin never fell below the normal range and multiple peripheral blood smears had minimal morphological evidence of hemolysis.

This patient in the preceding week was admitted under the care of medical specialty where a diagnosis of a spontaneous haematoma behind the thigh was made. Haematoma was thought to be a result of the patient being on oral anticoagulation (warfarin) for atrial fibrillation. The patient did not report history of trauma. He looked frail on the current admission on the vascular ward requiring support for some activities at home and had been on treatment for prostate cancer. He had previously also had coccygectomy for metastasis as well as a recent history of permanent pacemaker insertion for syncopal episodes and bradycardia. He also suffered from hypertension and was on a number of medications including warfarin. He was a lifelong nonsmoker and lived in a retirement home. There was no family history of aneurysms.\nExamination revealed extensive bruising at the back of the left thigh and knee with palpable femoral and pedal pulses. The popliteal pulse was difficult to feel due to a large haematoma. The left foot was viable with fully intact sensory and motor function. There was no clinical evidence of calf compartment syndrome on the left leg. The right foot was warm with all palpable pulses in the leg.\nAn initial ultrasound scan revealed PAA with no evidence of popliteal or femoral vein DVT.

An incisional biopsy was done at a local hospital, but it was not conclusive and the specimen was not available for reexamination. Clinically, the mass was fixed to the dermis and the flexor sheath. However, there was no numbness and there was full range of motion of the finger joints. A magnetic resonance imaging showed an enhancing lesion that is adherent to the flexor sheath []. Excisional biopsy was done through a zigzag volar incision. Intraoperatively the tumor was found to have ill defined borders. It was adherent to the dermis, flexor sheath and both digital nerves. Part of the flexor sheath was resected and the tumor was shaved off from the dermis by sharp dissection. No skin excision was done and both digital nerves were preserved. The tumor size was 2 × 1.5 cm []. Postoperatively, a small area of the skin flap became necrotic and this was treated conservatively []. Histological examination showed all the classic features of EHE. The tumor consisted of numerous epithelioid cells which are arranged in clusters, trabeculae and cords in a myxoid background []. Another characteristic histological feature of this tumor is the presence of intracytoplasmic vacuoles []. The mitotic rate was 3/10 high power fields (HPF) with evidence of focal pleomorphism.

{"note": "A 28-year-old woman was admitted to the neurology department after two transitory episodes lasting several hours of language impairment resembling motor aphasia and mild confusion. On admission, the neurologic examination, brain computed tomography scan, and electroencephalographic findings were unremarkable. A transient ischemic attack was suspected by the clinical symptoms and medical history. Thus, the patient underwent a carotid duplex ultrasound examination, which showed a parallel arterial flow at the origin of the internal carotid artery, potentially resembling a double lumen (). To exclude the dissection of the internal carotid artery, considering the very close proximity of the double lumen to the internal carotid artery for an extensive length, magnetic resonance angiography of the neck vessels was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging excluded a carotid artery dissection but identified an arterial branch arising from the post–bulbar internal carotid artery and flowing in close proximity to it (). The patient provided written informed consent for the report of her case details and imaging studies.\nFrom a neurologic viewpoint, carotid duplex ultrasound is widely used in everyday practice, especially when a cerebrovascular etiology is suspected and for challenging conditions such as carotid dissection. Considering that normal ultrasound examination findings will not rule out a priori the possibility of a carotid dissection, the presence of supportive ultrasound findings (eg, a potential double lumen) should deserve great attention and further diagnostic examinations (eg, angiography with magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomography). In contrast, the evaluation of potential anatomic variants of the external carotid artery is a very rare eventuality in neurologic ultrasound examination of supra-aortic trunks.\nTherefore, considering the anatomy of the neck vessels, two anatomic variants with an aberrant origin should be considered: (1) an ascending pharyngeal artery, or (2) an occipital artery., In both cases, these arteries will usually arise from the external carotid artery but can rarely present as anatomic variants with an aberrant origin from the internal carotid artery, , , ().

She had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis with a six-month course of anti-tuberculosis medication 20 years earlier. She did not have a history of smoking or environmental or occupational exposures to toxins. The laboratory tests including tumor markers on admission were normal. The result of acid fast staining of her sputum was also normal. Findings of physical examinations were unremarkable. The initial chest radiograph taken at the other hospital 8 months previously demonstrated an ambiguous consolidation in the left lower lung without a definite mass lesion (). The patient did not receive treatment for the lesion but has been followed-up for eight months. A chest radiograph taken eight months after the initial visit revealed an irregularly shaped large mass occupying the left lower lung field and compressing the left lower lobe and diaphragm (). Compared with the initial chest radiograph, the mass had grown markedly. Consequently, chest CT was carried out immediately. Chest CT showed two irregularly shaped soft tissue masses adjacent to the parietal pleura in the left hemithorax, which contained dense calcifications without the invasion of the ribs ().\nFor correct diagnosis and proper treatment, surgical excision of the masses was performed through left thoracotomy via the 7th intercostal space.

{"note": "A girl aged seven years and eight months was referred to our observation because of left peripheral facial palsy, causing the inability to close the left eye and dropping of the corner of the mouth. A first peripheral facial nerve palsy occurred when she was three years and one month old, with complete regression after corticosteroid treatment. At the age of three years and nine months, she was diagnosed with pure red cell hypoplasia, manifested as severe anaemia (haemoglobin: 3.00 g/dL; red blood cells: 1,000,000/mm3) with an extreme lack of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, but high growth of them in culture, probably caused by anti-EPO antibodies. The detection of anti-EPO antibodies, however, is not routinely performed in a clinical setting. The autoimmune hypothesis was postulated on empirical bases, since haemoglobin levels did not increase after recombinant human EPO administration, but normalized after corticosteroid therapy, and the addition of autologous serum to the erythroid precursor culture inhibited EPO growth. When she was 4 years and 4 months old, the patient presented with a second episode of left facial palsy, combined with the acute onset of a strength deficit on the left side of the body. Mingazzini I and II were positive for the left limbs. The imaging assessment showed a haemorrhagic stroke corresponding to the anterior portion of the right putamen and of the external capsule with perilesional oedema, involving the anterior limb of the internal capsule. Blood pressure measurements performed during the hospitalisation revealed high diastolic blood pressure values. These findings suggest a central rather than peripheral involvement of the facial nerve. Three weeks after their beginning, the symptoms had completely regressed.

The clinical picture together with electrocardiographic finding suggested a diagnosis of acute transmural infero-posterior associated with right ventricular myocardial infarction.\nImmediately after admission to the emergency room, the patient's conscious level ran a downhill course and he went into deep coma with a GCS of 3/15 and pinpoint pupils. A computed tomography of the brain was performed and revealed no abnormalities. This deterioration was presumed to be due to acute ischemic stroke not yet evident in the initial CT scan. Taking into consideration this sudden worsening of his conscious level and a calculated NIHSS score (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale) of >25 indicating a massive cerebral infarction, it was decided not to administer thrombolytic therapy. We also decided not to undergo primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty because of the bad prognosis of the patient. The patient was treated conservatively with antiplatelets, anticoagulant therapy and inotropic support for cardiogenic shock"}

He had sustained accidental electric burn injury (240V) while carrying out some work at home 2 hours prior to admission. He was thrown to the ground following an electrocution and was found to have brief period of loss of consciousness for few seconds with spontaneous recovery. He was immediately attended at a local hospital where ECG changes were noticed and referred to our institution for opinion and further management. He had no prior history of cardiac illness. There was no history of chest pain, palpitation or neurological deficits. There was no history suggestive of sudden or premature cardiac death in his family. He was not on any medications.\nOn physical examination, patient was conscious alert and had deep electric burn entry wound over the dorsum of left hand and an exit wound over the left ankle. The arterial blood pressure and heart rate were 120/80 mmHg and 78 beats per minute, respectively. Cardiovascular assessment was normal. Other systemic examinations were normal. Surface electrocardiogram done immediately following injury demonstrated a sinus rhythm with RBBB with coved ST segment elevation with negative T wave in V1 mimicking type 1 Brugada pattern and saddle back ST segment with upright T wave in V2 mimicking type 2 Brugada pattern with early repolarisation (). QTc was normal. Echocardiographic assessment revealed a normal left ventricular size and function, and no valvular pathology. Routine laboratory tests, including blood urea, serum creatinine, serum electrolytes and cardiac biomarkers were normal. Repeat ECG at 2 hours showed disappearance of above mentioned Brugada type pattern with persistent early repolarisation. Patient was observed in the ICU for rhythm disturbances for 24 hours.

He denied any vomiting, changes to his bowel habits, weight loss, fever or history of similar pain episodes. He was otherwise healthy and had no previous abdominal surgeries. On physical examination, there was some mild lower abdominal tenderness, but no mass was clinically palpable. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast was done and revealed a heterogeneous appearing mass like lesion in the midline of the pelvis measuring 11.4 × 6.8 × 6.6 cm. It showed peripheral enhancement with central hypodensity. The mass appears to be intimately associated with multiple segments of small bowel in the lower abdomen with no associated bowel obstruction (Fig. ). The initial radiologist impression was suggestive of a possible gastrointestinal stromal tumor. A CT scan of the chest was performed as well and there was no evidence of metastatic disease in the abdominal or thoracic cavities.\nThe case was discussed in multidisciplinary tumor boards and the consensus was to proceed with surgical resection of the primary tumor. The patient was therefore taken to the operating room for a diagnostic laparoscopy, laparotomy and resection of the mass which was not found to involve the small bowel. During laparoscopic exploration, we did not identify any liver metastases or peritoneal deposits. The mass was occupying the middle portion of the lower abdominal cavity. We elected to convert to an open procedure due to concerns of disrupting the integrity of the tumor during laparoscopic dissection given its large size and weight. It was connected to the greater omentum with a vascular pedicle and slightly adherent to epiploic appendages of the sigmoid colon. An intraoperative flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed and was unremarkable. The mass was not invading any intra-abdominal structures and there was no evidence of metastatic disease. It was resected en bloc with adequate margin on the omental pedicle. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged home on postoperative day three."}
{"note": "The 62-year-old male patient in this case report had a smoking history of more than 30 pack-years and a medical history of hypertension and diabetes. He had had a percutaneous coronary intervention 6 years previously due to angina and had noticed a cold and numbing sensation in the extremities of both hands for the previous 3 years. Two years previously, the patient's fourth finger on the left hand had experienced blue discoloration, with extreme pain of greater than 90/100 mm on the visual analogue scale (VAS), followed by ulceration. After a few tests at the orthopedic clinic, the patient had been diagnosed with Buerger's disease. He had been referred to the pain clinic for conservative treatment one year previously. On the patient's upper extremity angiography, greater than 80% stenosis was observed in the first and third finger artery in the area of radial artery and palmer arch, and greater than 90% stenosis was also observed in distal ulnar artery.\nAt the time of referral, the patient had been taking oxycodone 40 mg twice a day, as well as limaprost 5 µg and gabapentin 300 mg 3 times day. Even with an increase in opiate dose and several chest sympathetic block and stellate ganglion blocks, the analgesic effect was temporal. The pain and ulcers on the fingers worsened, and a finger amputation was planned as arterial bypass surgery was not a valid method for this patient. Although a number of treatments were tried, the patient complained about extreme pain, 90/100 mm on VAS, and there were severe gangrenous ulcers progressing on the fourth finger of the left hand and the index finger of the right hand. The patient was very much against the amputation even though he was under extreme pain and had been referred to the pain clinic several times. Hence, the decision was made to attempt spinal cord stimulation prior to amputation.\nThe blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and electrocardiography were monitored, and, with the patient in the prone position, local anesthesia was performed"}
{"note": "An 87 year old woman patient reported to the outdoor department of our hospital with a history of having sustained a fall in her bathroom. The patient complained of tenderness and pain in the right hip and thigh. The extremity was externally rotated and shortened. Movement elicited pain in the area of the right hip. Radiographs of the right femur revealed a transverse fracture of the right subtrochanteric region. On assessing the trabecular pattern of the trochanteric region the patient was found to have Singh's grade one porosis with near absence of the trabeculae in the femoral head and neck.\nThe patient was put on traction and advised to undergo surgery in view of the nature of the fracture and the requirement of early ambulation. Dual X-ray absorbsiometry showed a T score greater than 2.5 standard deviations below normal.\nIn view of the extremely thin cortices of the femur, it was felt that the oft required schanz pin assisted reduction, needed for guide wire insertion in interlocking nailing, could damage the cortices at the insertion site. Besides this the possibility of cut out precluded the use of dynamic hip screw fixation. The DCS along with cancellous screws was chosen to circumvent these problems.\nThe fracture was reduced on a traction table after opening the area. Fixation was held with a dynamic condylar screw [DCS] and 95 degree barrel plate. In view of the tenuous nature of the cortices the plate was affixed with four cancellous screws on either side of the fracture.\nPost operatively the patient underwent supervised physiotherapy over a period of six weeks. At ten weeks the fracture had united and the patient was allowed full weight bearing. The patient simultaneously was put on treatment with bisphosphonates for the underlying osteoporosis which was primarily of the senile variety.\nAt the last follow-up [3 years post operative] the patient was pain free with full range of motion of the hip joint. The patient's cortex thickness had also improved at this time as seen on radiographs."}

She had no abdominal pains and her weight was maintained. The patient had been born with bladder exstrophy and had multiple surgeries culminating in a cystectomy with ileal conduit formation at 5 years of age. She had suffered with recurrent urinary tract infections for most of her childhood and adult life but was otherwise well with no other major co-morbidities or risk factors for colorectal malignancy and had no family history of colorectal disease.\nColonoscopy revealed two large sessile polyps in the sigmoid colon in close proximity to each other and adjacent to a diverticulum-like structure (Fig. ). Each polyp was approximately 3 cm in size and both exhibited a type IV pit pattern with areas of irregularity suggestive of focally advanced disease. Histological examination confirmed both polyps were adenomas comprising both low and high grade dysplasia, without submucosal invasion (Fig. ). On closer inspection the mucosa around the diverticulum was also atypical but not adenomatous. The remainder of the colonoscopy was unremarkable with no other evidence of diverticular disease or polyps elsewhere.\nEndoscopic resection was considered as a therapeutic option however in view of the above characteristics as well as difficult endoscopic access surgery was preferred. Furthermore, radiological imaging had initially raised the possibility of invasive disease in view of sigmoid thickening. The patient underwent high anterior resection and an open approach was chosen because of suspected intra-abdominal adhesions following extensive pelvic surgery. An end colostomy was formed at the patient’s pre-operative request. At laparotomy the right fallopian tube was adherent to the sigmoid colon and adjacent to this a blind ending tube was noted to emerge from the anti-mesenteric border of the colon. This was marked for pathological identification.\nOur patient went on to have an uneventful recovery and her quality of life following surgery was good. Her wish to have a permanent colostomy stemmed from the fact that"}

The patient reported previous benign excisional biopsy of a breast lump around age 50 with no breast-related concerns since that time. About two years ago, she noticed a lump in the left breast that appeared to increase in size over time. Around the same time, she had a single episode of spontaneous bloody discharge from the left nipple. Due to various personal reasons, she delayed her own care and had not sought breast evaluations until the size of the mass had reached a point that prompted her to have it assessed. She had not experienced any pain, discharge, or skin breakdown in her breast, other than some discomfort related to the fullness. She had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer and no risk factors for breast cancer other than her age.\nClinical examination revealed a large left breast mass measuring ∼20 cm involving the inferior and medial left breast. The overlying skin was bluish-purple in color, with a lateral deviation and distortion of the nipple (Fig.). Upon palpation, the mass measured ∼20 × 15 cm with thickening of the nipple. The patient also had a small mass on the left upper anterior chest that had remained unchanged for several years.\nBreast imaging work up included mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Diagnostic mammography revealed a large mass in the left breast and a few scattered coarse calcifications (Fig.A). Ultrasound examination demonstrated a complex vascular mass with a large homogenous fluid component occupying the majority of the left breast with features suspicious of malignancy (Fig.). Bilateral MRI was performed to further characterize the mass, revealing a 13 × 11 × 13 cm mass with both cystic and enhancing solid components abutting the chest wall and the lateral aspect of the mass demonstrating skin involvement (Fig.). Additionally, the small palpable mass on the superior left chest wall was consistent with a lipoma.\nImaging features were suggestive of malignancy and the differential diagnosis"}

Physical examination revealed feeble femoral pulses and he was found to be hypertensive with marked differences between the upper and lower limbs (systolic blood pressure upper limb 190mmmHg, lower limb 75 mmHg, with an ankle brachial index (ABI) of 0.39). Electrocardiogram revealed evidence of severe left ventricular hypertrophy. This was confirmed with echocardiography which also demonstrated a tricuspid aortic valve with significant aortic regurgitation in the presence of an aortic root aneurysm of approximately 9 cm. Left ventricular function was preserved. Computerised tomography angiography (CTA) was performed to evaluate the aortic pathology in further detail (Fig. ). The scan noted an aortic root aneurysm (8.8 cm), in addition to the presence of severe aortic coarctation, with subtotal occlusion and a lumen less than 6 mm in size. The coarctation was just distal to the left subclavian artery, at the aortic isthmus. There was clear evidence of collateral circulation to the descending thoracic aorta via the subclavian and intercostal arteries. Coronary angiography confirmed a right dominant coronary system with no significant coronary disease.\nA multidisciplinary team meeting took place and a consensus was agreed to proceed with a two staged hybrid approach, with the first phase involving an endovascular approach to stent the coarctation, followed by a second stage to perform the surgical repair of the aortic root aneurysm. The first stage to stent the coarctation was unsuccessful via the femoral approach, as the guidewire could not cross the coarctation. Assessment through angiography via the left brachial artery showed complete obstruction at the aortic isthmus. The decision was then made to proceed to a single stage surgical approach to treat both lesions.\nAfter induction of anaesthesia, arterial lines were placed in the left radial and left femoral artery. A right infraclavicular incision and a right groin incision was made this was to establish peripheral arterial cannulation access to the right axillary and right femoral artery. An 8 mm dacron"}

In the same year, she presented with a local recurrence and had a repeat curettage and cementation of the lesion with polymethylmethacrylate. The patient remained symptom-free for 20 years until she presented to our clinic with increasing knee pain and functional impairment secondary to degenerative change within the knee joint.\nOn physical examination, she had a longitudinal anteromedial knee scar with a 10-degree varus deformity. Range of motion was from 15° to 90° of flexion. Plain knee radiographs showed a large bolus of cement occupying the medial femoral condyle, extending superiorly into the metadiaphyseal junction. The joint space showed significant narrowing. There was no evidence of loosening of the cement or tumor recurrence ().\nThe patient was offered a total knee replacement. Different reconstruction options were considered and included a modular oncologic prosthesis and allograft prosthetic composite. However, taking into consideration the good quality of the cement bed, a standard total knee replacement was planned. We had a modular tumor prosthesis available as a backup option.\nAt surgery, severe articular cartilage wear was noted especially in the medial compartment; however, the cement had not yet worn completely through into the joint. The femoral medullary canal was initially opened using a combination of a drill and burr to accommodate a standard intramedullary guide rod. The distal femoral cut was done using a standard saw cutting through the cement without difficulty. The remainder of the femoral cuts were completed after appropriate sizing of the distal femur. The cement remained well interdigitated to the host bone throughout the femoral preparation with no evidence of loosening or fragmentation (). Due to the presence of the cement, a cruciate retaining femoral component was selected in order to avoid further cutting into the cement for the box of a posterior stabilized femoral component (). The proximal tibia was prepared using standard techniques. The patella was resurfaced."}

The mass was painless and gradually increasing in size. The family members of this patient brought her to a traditional healer. They did not seek any medical treatment until late 2017. By this time, the mass over the sacrum was extremely large. Family members claimed the mass was preventing the patient from lying down flat supine. The patient was also unable to ambulate for the past 2 years. Hence, she was bedbound most of the time. It was difficult for her to sit on the wheelchair. She also felt tired to move because the mass was quite heavy. The family members claimed when the patient was lying down flat, she had to flex her hips and knees to achieve a more comfortable position. In addition, she often slept either in prone position or in supine with multiple pillows below her body. The mother also claimed over the last 2 months, the patient’s body had been getting thinner despite her physical weight was increasing due to the increase in size of the sacral mass.

The deformity had progressed rapidly from mild difficulty in keeping the head up to head drop over a period of 5 months (). Upon admission, he could maintain his head up with extreme effort only for about five minutes. However, he was able to correct the deformity passively with his hands and the deformity could be relieved spontaneously in a supine position. He denied any other weakness in his extremities or difficulties in chewing and swallowing. The dropped head position had severely impaired the patient's activities of daily living and withdrawn him from social contacts. He used to wear a collar for outdoor activities such as shopping but he preferred to stay home most of the times. For most of his activities and for having a meal, he used to hold his head with the left hand instead of the collar. This type of correction was repeated several times in a day. Neurological examination showed normal parameters. Cervical spine radiographs revealed degenerative changes and flexion deformity of the neck (). MRI revealed cervical spondylotic changes with mild compression of the spinal cord (Figures and ). Clinical diagnosis of isolated neck extensor myopathy (INEM) was suspected.

The bone scan was obtained at 4th hour following the injection of 925 MBq of technetium 99m methylene diphosphonate (99mTc MDP). The images were obtained with low energy high resolution collimator with a 20 % window set at a 140 keV energy peak. The bed speed was 9 cm/min for continuous acquisition. There were not any significant focal activities indicating micro fractures in the skeleton. But, interestingly diffuse 99mTc MDP uptake was noticed bilaterally in the kidneys ().\nThe patient anamnesis and the patient files were investigated for the possible differential diagnosis of the observed diffuse renal uptake. There was not a history of an oncologic or chronic disease. There was not any history of chemotherapy, radiation therapy or antibiotherapy. There were not any complaints of urinary tract obstruction or symptoms of urinary tract infection. The patient was normotensive. The only medication the patient intakes was diclofenac (75 mg, 2x1 po.) for some months. So, the probability of acute kidney injury as the reason for the bilateral diffuse renal uptake of 99mTc MDP was reported.

She was referred to our hospital three days later with complaints of severe pain, swelling around the right elbow and numbness of fingers. As per the treatment notes there was no obvious neuro vascular injury and radialartery pulse was felt immediately after reduction of elbow dislocation. On examination, We noted that the elbow was swollen, there were superficial blebs, forearm was tense, and there was mild stretch pain. Vascular examination showed good capillary refill with palpable radial artery pulse and decreased sensation over fingers. We evaluated the patient using X-ray of the right elbow -which showed well reduced dislocation and no evidence of fracture. To rule out any vascular injury, arterial doppler scan was performed which showed -large hematoma causing extrinsic compression over distal end of brachial artery with minimal monophasic flow in distal arteries. We took the patient for brachial artery exploration to clear-the hematoma under general anesthesia. A two cm vertical incision was made over medial aspect of lower arm and hematoma was removed. We were surprised to note a pulsating tubular structure with occluded lumen, which led to our suspicion of a complete brachial artery rupture. Immediately, the patient was referred to a vascular surgeon for CT-angiography and for further management. CT angiography showed complete right brachial artery transection five cm above the elbow with thrombus in both ends and significant blood flow in distal arteries through collateral circulation ().

The surgery was carried out under general anaesthesia, with epidural analgesia. The patient was positioned on a fracture table. The well leg was placed in hemilithotomy position in 70° flexion and 40° abduction, and it was placed on a leg holder. The patient was maintained in this position throughout the procedure. Following closed reduction of the fracture, nailing was attempted. But the failure to obtain acceptable reduction initially increased the surgical time; the intraoperative plan was changed and fixation with a dynamic condylar screw (DCS) was performed (fig. ). The total surgical time was 2 h and 30 min. There was 650 ml of blood loss and 1 unit of whole blood was transfused intraoperatively. The patient's arterial blood pressure was maintained by the anaesthetists at 94/60 mm Hg or above throughout the procedure as a preventive measure to reduce bleeding at the operative site.

The patient reported that she had noticed the mass for the first time 13 years ago and has been followed up regularly. There was no history of any infective lesion, trauma, or any family history of aneurysm disease. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Initially, she has treated conservatively and due to the appearance of the symptoms such as enlargement of the size of the mass and dyspnea on exertion. She had been managed with endovascular treatment as parent vessel occlusion 4 years ago []. There was shrinkage of the size of the mass and improvement of the symptoms. Over the past 6 months, the size has again started to enlarge and also the appearance of the symptoms and its pulsatile nature became more evident. Clinical examination showed a pulsatile mass on the right side of the neck. No neurologic symptoms occurred in the patient. Examination of the cranial nerves showed no anomalies. A computed tomography (CT) angiography followed, verifying the presence of a fusiform giant aneurysm of the right ICA, measuring 5 cm in diameter. To further define the right EICA and the remaining cerebral circulation, CT angiography was performed with three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. The 3D reconstruction confirmed a fusiform aneurysm arising from the proximal right EICA []. Despite the patient had undergone endovascular management 4 years ago in the form of parent vessel occlusion, we could see the minimal flow in the EICA which may be due to recanalization. No intracranial aneurysmal disease was identified. The aneurysm measurements were 25 mm × 30 mm, with a cranial-caudal length of 50 mm and a wide neck. An aneurysm extended from 2 cm after the carotid bifurcation nearly to the base of the skull.

A 1-year history was reported on blurriness and visual indistinctness that had progressively worsened over the past 2 weeks. He has a record of tuberculosis and takes anti-TB drugs on a regular basis. Neurologic examinations at the time of admission revealed no focal neurologic deficits except for oculomotor paralysis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that the diameter of intracranial segment in the left internal carotid artery was significantly dilated, the inner diameter was approximately 14 mm, the left anterior cerebral artery, and the starting point of the MCA were slightly dilated as well, and the structure of the left cavernous sinus area lacked clarity. There was a circular liquid signal shadow spotted under the inner wall of the left maxillary sinus, the diameter of which was about 16 mm (Fig. ). Further cerebral angiography indicated that the left internal carotid artery GSA was about 48.61 mm × 23.40 mm in size, 4.65 mm in diameter of proximal vessels, and 3.16 mm in diameter of distal vessels (Fig. ).\nHis family was informed of these conditions and signed a consent form prior to the operation. The balloon occlusion test conducted previous to surgery indicated that the anterior communicating artery was open and the contralateral internal carotid artery had a good compensatory blood supply, as a result of which direct trapping of the parent artery was taken as an alternative method. However, ipsilateral MA has a potential of further growth which could lead to paralysis of facial nerve compression, which is due to higher blood flow to the external carotid artery. His family members rejected this traumatic treatment method and thus the insertion of stents was chosen to reconstruct the original structure of the vessel. Therefore, the following surgery was performed: antiplatelet therapy (100 mg aspirin + 75 mg clopidogrel daily) was carried out at least 3 days prior to the operation, and he underwent surgery after being diagnosed with anesthesia.

He was first admitted to the cardiology unit of a general hospital in January 2011 after he collapsed during jogging. Following basic cardiac life support he was rushed to the emergency room of the general hospital. He was diagnosed to have acute myocardial infarction secondary to triple vessel disease and was arranged for coronary artery bypass surgery when his physical condition was stabilised. The electroencephalography and computerised tomography (CT) scans of the brain done on the day of admission in view of his fall were normal but the magnetic resonance imaging of the brain 10 days later showed mild generalized involutional change and disproportionate atrophy of basal ganglia and hippocampus. He regained full consciousness about 5 hours after the admission and was noted to have resting tremors and mild cogwheel rigidity before the administration of any psychotropic medications. He showed mild impairment in both retrograde and anterograde memory, which was greater for short term than long term memory. Subsequently, he was observed to have fluctuating conscious state and agitation but no localised motor or sensory neurological deficits. Laboratory investigations, which were performed including full blood count, renal, liver, thyroid function tests, and infective screen did not reveal any abnormalities.

His medications included aspirin, beta blockers, and nitrates. However, this patient was not receiving any anticoagulation. On admission to the hospital the patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiography that showed mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction of 40% to 45% and mild dilation of both atria. The presence of interatrial septal aneurysm was not noticed. Coronary angiography revealed severe stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery. The EuroSCORE Logistic was estimated at 4.36%. A transesophageal echocardiography was performed after induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation, and revealed a large echogenic mass in the right atrium (). The mass was at first thought to be a large myxoma or probably thrombus attached to the atrial septum. Continuing with TEE examination, a visible deficiency was observed in the huge mass which was attached to the atrial septum. This was possibly due to a detachment of part of the thrombus (Figures and ). The extraction of the echogenic parts towards the left atrium raised the suspicion of an atrial septal aneurysm which was completely filled with thrombi. In the following echo recordings, these thrombi were not visible any more (). A huge atrial septal aneurysm was revealed, after bolus injection of agitated saline in the right jugular vein with automated contrast () and having used provocation manoeuvres including ventilation with PEEP (15 cm H2O) and high tidal volume, a patent foramen ovale was established.

The initial approach was conservative aiming to keep the upper front by means of composite fillings (Figures and ). Then, the posterior superior quadrants needed to be restored with implants.\nThree years after, in 2017, the patient came back to the office referring pain of endodontic origin in the upper left canine. New and secondary subgingival caries were found in the six front teeth. The conservative prognosis was considered poor due to the subgingival depth and extent of decay presented by the lesions from canine to canine. After having discussed the treatment options, especially the surgical lengthening of the front teeth or the orthodontic extrusion, the patient decides to replace the residual teeth with a new implant-supported bridge similar to the recently performed prostheses of the posterior areas that were judged by him as a highly satisfactory treatment. The patient preferred not to involve these restorations in the present anterior treatment and limited it to place only two implants in the lateral incisors' positions ().\nThe treatment was carried out in a staged approach. Briefly, first, we extracted the lateral incisors, using the SST, and placed two immediate implants. The four residual teeth were then prepared to be used as abutments of a temporary bridge for the purpose of maintaining the aesthetics and function of the patient during the early osseointegration period. In a further step, the four remaining teeth were also extracted using the SST, and the initial provisional bridge was replaced by the second provisional screwed on the uncovered implants.

The patient's chief complaint was left side facial growth without pain. The patient had no history of systemic diseases. Extraoral examination showed an obvious unilateral swelling centered over the mandibular angle. Palpation indicated that the swollen tissue was normal in tone and nontender. Mandibular movements were in the normal range. When the patient was asked to clench, the swelling became more prominent and firm. The patient said that he uses the left side of the jaw more while chewing food. There was no history of temporomandibular joint clicking, and no family history of masseter hypertrophy. Physical examination revealed that the patient had unilateral masseter muscle bulging, with a prominent mandibular angle at the lower border. Intraoral examination revealed distoangularly impacted 38 and 48. OPG showed a prominent mandibular angle. Data from clinical and radiographic examination led to the diagnosis of unilateral masseter muscle hypertrophy (Figures , , , , , and ). Nonsurgical options such as botox therapy and the advantages and disadvantages of both surgery and botox treatment were discussed with the patient. The patient opted for surgical option as he wanted to get rid of the scar immediately and we told him that we can do the correction of masseter hypertrophy and scar revision through one incisional approach only.

The veins had been divided at the level of the inferior vena cava; a caval tube had not been provided.\nThe recipient was a 47-year-old female with a body mass index of 28.5 m2/kg and end-stage renal failure secondary to chronic pyelonephritis. The kidney was implanted into the right iliac fossa. The main hilar renal vein was anastomosed end to side to the external iliac vein using 5/0 polypropylene and the renal arterial patch was anastomosed end to side to the external iliac artery using 5/0 polypropylene. The lower polar vein was controlled with a fine atraumatic vascular clamp and not anastomosed initially. On release of the arterial and venous clamps, the kidney appeared globally well perfused and some urine production was observed. Nonetheless, both the main hilar and lower polar veins were distended and felt congested. On-table Doppler ultrasound was performed by members of the surgical team. This confirmed that the kidney was globally perfused but the waveforms showed reversal of flow in diastole throughout the kidney.

Physical examination revealed a palpable mass on the upper part of his right arm with a size 13 × 12 cm. Radiographic examination demonstrated a large mass over 10 cm in diameter on the proximal humerus, with massive cortical erosion, extension of the tumor into soft tissues and indistinctness of the surface of the tumor (). A diagnosis of chondrosarcoma was made in view of the radiologic findings in combination with the histology by the needle biopsy. The specimen was histologically classified as grade II chondrosarcoma. The patient had a 20-year history of a painless and palpable bony mass on this location and had gradually increased in size. He first sought treatment at age 16 because he had a distal radius fracture.

A first peripheral facial nerve palsy occurred when she was three years and one month old, with complete regression after corticosteroid treatment. At the age of three years and nine months, she was diagnosed with pure red cell hypoplasia, manifested as severe anaemia (haemoglobin: 3.00 g/dL; red blood cells: 1,000,000/mm3) with an extreme lack of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, but high growth of them in culture, probably caused by anti-EPO antibodies. The detection of anti-EPO antibodies, however, is not routinely performed in a clinical setting. The autoimmune hypothesis was postulated on empirical bases, since haemoglobin levels did not increase after recombinant human EPO administration, but normalized after corticosteroid therapy, and the addition of autologous serum to the erythroid precursor culture inhibited EPO growth. When she was 4 years and 4 months old, the patient presented with a second episode of left facial palsy, combined with the acute onset of a strength deficit on the left side of the body. Mingazzini I and II were positive for the left limbs. The imaging assessment showed a haemorrhagic stroke corresponding to the anterior portion of the right putamen and of the external capsule with perilesional oedema, involving the anterior limb of the internal capsule. Blood pressure measurements performed during the hospitalisation revealed high diastolic blood pressure values. These findings suggest a central rather than peripheral involvement of the facial nerve. Three weeks after their beginning, the symptoms had completely regressed.

Electrocardiogram revealed evidence of severe left ventricular hypertrophy. This was confirmed with echocardiography which also demonstrated a tricuspid aortic valve with significant aortic regurgitation in the presence of an aortic root aneurysm of approximately 9 cm. Left ventricular function was preserved. Computerised tomography angiography (CTA) was performed to evaluate the aortic pathology in further detail (Fig. ). The scan noted an aortic root aneurysm (8.8 cm), in addition to the presence of severe aortic coarctation, with subtotal occlusion and a lumen less than 6 mm in size.

Mouth opening was restricted and widespread tenderness and oedema were detected by palpation on the left temporomandibular joint and left maxillary region. The functions of the facial nerve of the patient were intact. The patient’s brain and maxillofacial tomography showed multiple segmental fracture lines in the anterior and lateral walls of the maxillary sinus, in the zygomatic process, in the mandible and the pterygoid process.\nDiffuse air images and areas of hematoma were observed in the adjacent soft tissue. At the same time, a metallic foreign body image with a diameter of 1 cm was seen in the subcutaneous fatty tissues in the posterior neighborhood of the mandible on the left side ().

Except for the trauma he did not have a significant history of illness. The patient was subjected to a brain computed tomography (CT) scan which showed the presence of a combined right supra-subtentorial hematoma (Figure ). Clinical evaluation of the patient did not reveal any neurological signs except for a mild headache. Because of the site of the hematoma, an involvement of the transverse sinus was suspected. As a consequence a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with arterial and venous reconstruction was performed. The MRI confirmed the presence of the hematoma involving the supratentorial and the subtentorial compartment. Furthermore the venous study did not show any appreciable signal of blood flow within the right transverse sinus. This radiological finding was likely to be due to the occlusion of the sinus (Figures and ). Because of the absence of neurological signs as well as the patency of the contralateral dural sinuses system, a conservative management was adopted. A CT scan performed 48 h after the accident showed a slight increase in the size of the hematoma (Figure ). As a consequence, administration of LMWH was delayed. By the 10th post-traumatic day two more brain CT scan had been performed which had shown the progressive decrease in the size of the hematoma (Figure ). This reduction encouraged us to begin the administration of LMWH. On 15th post-traumatic day the patient was discharged at home.

After the femur preparation, tibial preparation was started with removal of fibrous tissue at the fracture site, anatomical reduction of fracture, and maintaining the reduction with reduction forceps till the completion of the tibial preparation to prevent the displacement of fracture fragment. Cemented TKR was done using Zimmer implant of femoral component size E, tibial component of size 4 with stem extension of 12 mm diameter × 155 mm length and articular surface height of 10 mm ( and ). As the fracture was properly reduced to anatomical position and there was only fracture split, no depression, the augmentation was not required. Wound was closed in layers and the patient was given long knee brace postoperatively. Partial"}
{"note": "Our patient is a 27-year old female that denied any past medical and surgical history. Her family and drug history were also unremarkable. The patient presented with a 7-month history of progressively enlarging mass on her left ring finger. The patient mentioned that the mass appeared suddenly with no history of trauma and that she was concerned about the potential malignant nature of the mass. The patient also mentioned that she underwent incision and drainage of that mass 2 months after its appearance with no improvement and provided no detailed surgical or pathological reports, which was the reason for her delayed presentation. Upon her assessment, the mass was located over the ulnar side of the proximal phalanx of left ring finger with extensive involvement of the 4th web space. The overlying skin coverage was ulcerative with no active signs of infection. Range of motion of the involved digit was limited, however neurovascular examination was normal. ().\nRadiological evaluation of the involved hand showed a soft tissue swelling with no evidence of bone involvement (). Further magnetic resonant (MRI) evaluation showed a mass on the volar aspect of the ring finger encasing about 50% of the flexor tendons of that digit with low signal intensity on T1 and high signal intensity on T2 evaluation with strong enhancement in post contrast evaluation. Assessment of neurovascular structures showed partial abutment of the radial sided bundle together with complete encirclement of the ulnar sided neurovascular bundle. The surrounding bone was free of any masses and associated mass effect.\nThe patient was taken to the OR for exploration and mass excision by the senior author. Possible risks associated with such intervention were explained. Intra-operatively, bruner type incision was designed together with island of skin involved in the mass. Exploration revealed extensive subcutaneous mass with fibro-fatty consistency with extensive fascia like extension to the surrounding soft tissue. The mass was encircling the ulnar neurovascular bundle with mass abutment over the radial bundle as seen in pre-op assessment. The mass was dissected freely"}

She complained of a six month history of tearing and a two month history of occasional bloody discharge from the left eye as well as left medial canthal region swelling. The swelling was not associated with pain or visual disturbance. The patient had no previous history of regional surgery or trauma or excessive sun exposure. There was no history of a cutaneous primary melanoma.\nThe physical examination revealed a cystic, localized, non tender palpable mass at the left medial canthus consistent with an enlargement of the lacrimal sac. Computed tomography scanning of the paranasal sinus showed a soft tissue mass in the left lacrimal sac, attached to the medial orbital wall (). However, neither orbital cavity involvement nor bony destruction was detected. In addition, infiltration of the surrounding soft tissue was not detected, and the mass did not extend into the nasolacrimal duct. There was no associated cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient was taken to the operating room for a scheduled dacryocystectomy. A brown-pigmented soft tissue containing cystic mass filled the lacrimal sac and did not protrude through the nasolacrimal duct. The mass was removed from the nasal and lacrimal bone and dissected from the medial canthal tendon. The cystic mass was thought to be benign and therefore only a dacryocystectomy was performed.\nBiopsy and histological examination of the surgical specimen showed solid growth of malignant cells characterized by production of melanin pigments and hyperchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli (). The tumor cells showed strong immunoreactivity to melanoma specific antibody, HBM-45 in the immunohistochemical examination, consistent with a diagnosis of malignant melanoma (); whereas the immunoreactivity to the S 100 protein was negative. This histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of malignant melanoma and the resection margins were not free of tumor. A complete metastatic workup including computed tomography scanning of the head and neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis failed to demonstrate lymphadenopathy or other evidence of metastasis"}

A hamstring graft was used for subsequent ACL reconstruction, and it was performed outside our institution by a senior and experienced surgeon. Patients could walk normally in about 6 months, although heavy sports activity has not yet been achieved. The patient remained without symptoms for the next six years. He began to experience pain and swelling over his knee after a six-year period. There was no history of trauma. There was also stiffness of the knee. The patient had difficulty moving his knee. The patient had a previous history of hyperuricemia without symptoms and did not take medication routinely.\nThe physical examination revealed a painful, swollen knee without sinus discharge and limitations in knee flexion-extension that ranged from 30 to 80 degrees (). Special tests such as the Lachman test as well as the pivot shift test could not be done properly due to the limitation of the knee range of motion. In addition, the left contralateral knee shows similar manifestation clinically with tenderness, mild swelling, stiffness and limited range of motion.\nThe radiographic finding shows early arthritic changes in the knee. This kind of plain x-ray of the knee resembles a picture of the degenerative condition of joints (). Besides, the MRI shows effusion, and there is a suggested solid mass on the posterior part of the femoral notch with suspected arthrofibrosis. The previous graft is nowhere to be seen in . Laboratory results prior to the surgery revealed an increase in urate acid level in the serum of about 11.6 mg/dL. Synovial fluid analysis showed an increase in urate crystals as well as polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) count ().\nAfter explanation and education regarding the problem, informed consent was taken and arthroscopic debridement was obtained and some tissue samples were obtained for pathological analysis.

The mass was painless and gradually increasing in size. The family members of this patient brought her to a traditional healer. They did not seek any medical treatment until late 2017. By this time, the mass over the sacrum was extremely large. Family members claimed the mass was preventing the patient from lying down flat supine. The patient was also unable to ambulate for the past 2 years. Hence, she was bedbound most of the time. It was difficult for her to sit on the wheelchair. She also felt tired to move because the mass was quite heavy. The family members claimed when the patient was lying down flat, she had to flex her hips and knees to achieve a more comfortable position. In addition, she often slept either in prone position or in supine with multiple pillows below her body. The mother also claimed over the last 2 months, the patient’s body had been getting thinner despite her physical weight was increasing due to the increase in size of the sacral mass. The patient had been passing stool and urine in pampers. There was no past medical history and no family history of cancer. Socially, the patient lived with her mother and siblings. The mother was the main care taker. Her father passed away 10 years ago because of heart attack. The patient previously attended a special needs school, but she stopped going to school since 2015 after developing the sacral mass.\nThis patient was managed in the Southern Region referral centre for Orthopaedic Oncology in Malaysia.

She had no abdominal pains and her weight was maintained. The patient had been born with bladder exstrophy and had multiple surgeries culminating in a cystectomy with ileal conduit formation at 5 years of age. She had suffered with recurrent urinary tract infections for most of her childhood and adult life but was otherwise well with no other major co-morbidities or risk factors for colorectal malignancy and had no family history of colorectal disease.\nColonoscopy revealed two large sessile polyps in the sigmoid colon in close proximity to each other and adjacent to a diverticulum-like structure (Fig. ). Each polyp was approximately 3 cm in size and both exhibited a type IV pit pattern with areas of irregularity suggestive of focally advanced disease. Histological examination confirmed both polyps were adenomas comprising both low and high grade dysplasia, without submucosal invasion (Fig. ). On closer inspection the mucosa around the diverticulum was also atypical but not adenomatous. The remainder of the colonoscopy was unremarkable with no other evidence of diverticular disease or polyps elsewhere.\nEndoscopic resection was considered as a therapeutic option however in view of the above characteristics as well as difficult endoscopic access surgery was preferred. Furthermore, radiological imaging had initially raised the possibility of invasive disease in view of sigmoid thickening. The patient underwent high anterior resection and an open approach was chosen because of suspected intra-abdominal adhesions following extensive pelvic surgery. An end colostomy was formed at the patient’s pre-operative request. At laparotomy the right fallopian tube was adherent to the sigmoid colon and adjacent to this a blind ending tube was noted to emerge from the anti-mesenteric border of the colon. This was marked for pathological identification.\nOur patient went on to have an uneventful recovery and her quality of life following surgery was good.

This was a spontaneous conception with no previous fertility treatment. She did not use any contraception in the interim.\nThree years earlier she was diagnosed with a right tubal ectopic pregnancy which was treated by a laparoscopic salpingectomy. Prior to that she had two normal pregnancies and deliveries. She did not have any risk factors for an ectopic pregnancy at that time. The left fallopian tube looked normal at the time of the laparoscopy.\nShe was completely asymptomatic at the initial consultation. A transvaginal scan showed an irregular gestational sac of approximately 8 weeks with a yolk sac but no fetal pole (Figure ). There was a corpus luteal cyst noted in the left ovary with a small amount of free fluid in the Pouch of Douglas. The right ovary was normal with no obvious adnexal masses seen. A rescan was scheduled in 10 days time to check for viability of the pregnancy.\nHowever six days later the patient presented as an emergency with acute left sided abdomino-pelvic pain and generally feeling unwell. She had no vaginal bleeding. On examination she was cold, clammy and hypotensive. Abdominal examination was suggestive of an acute abdomen with severe tenderness, guarding and rigidity. Clinical differential diagnosis at that stage was a possible bleed from the corpus luteal cyst which was seen in the initial scan or an ectopic pregnancy.\nA transvaginal scan done by the same senior sonographer showed the intrauterine gestational sac similar to the previous scan few days earlier. In addition however there was a left adnexal mass with a gestational sac and a fetal pole suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy (Figure ). There was a faint fetal heart seen in the fetal pole.

The swelling was initially small and gradually reached the present size over two months. On extraoral examination, a diffuse swelling in the left submandibular region was present. On intraoral examination, a single well-defined encapsulated swelling was present in the left side of floor of the mouth (). On palpation, the swelling was tender, firm, and nonfluctuant and the swelling extends anteroposteriorly from the midline of the floor of the mouth to the second molar region in the left side of the mandible (). Patient was having altered sensations in the left lateral border of tongue and the lingual mucoperiosteum of the left side of mandible which suggested that the mass related to the lingual nerve. FNAC was found negative as the swelling was firm.\nAxial computed tomogram of head and neck showed a dense mass in the left side of floor of the mouth region measuring about 33 mm × 23 mm with a dilated lingual nerve found within the mass (Figures and ).\nUnder general anaesthesia, a mucosal incision was placed over the mass in the left side of the floor of the mouth, the tumor was exposed and dissected safely from the lingual nerve, and excision was carried out by ligating the lingual nerve on the distal and mesial end of the swelling (). The encapsulated tumor was then excised completely from the lingual nerve and the lingual nerve repair was done by perineural suturing. Macroscopic examination of the excised specimen reveals a well-encapsulated mass and the cut surface of the specimen measures about 3.5 cm × 4 cm × 3 cm showing an area of cystic degeneration and solid areas (Figures and ).

{"note": "A girl aged seven years and eight months was referred to our observation because of left peripheral facial palsy, causing the inability to close the left eye and dropping of the corner of the mouth. A first peripheral facial nerve palsy occurred when she was three years and one month old, with complete regression after corticosteroid treatment. At the age of three years and nine months, she was diagnosed with pure red cell hypoplasia, manifested as severe anaemia (haemoglobin: 3.00 g/dL; red blood cells: 1,000,000/mm3) with an extreme lack of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, but high growth of them in culture, probably caused by anti-EPO antibodies. The detection of anti-EPO antibodies, however, is not routinely performed in a clinical setting. The autoimmune hypothesis was postulated on empirical bases, since haemoglobin levels did not increase after recombinant human EPO administration, but normalized after corticosteroid therapy, and the addition of autologous serum to the erythroid precursor culture inhibited EPO growth. When she was 4 years and 4 months old, the patient presented with a second episode of left facial palsy, combined with the acute onset of a strength deficit on the left side of the body. Mingazzini I and II were positive for the left limbs. The imaging assessment showed a haemorrhagic stroke corresponding to the anterior portion of the right putamen and of the external capsule with perilesional oedema, involving the anterior limb of the internal capsule. Blood pressure measurements performed during the hospitalisation revealed high diastolic blood pressure values. These findings suggest a central rather than peripheral involvement of the facial nerve. Three weeks after their beginning, the symptoms had completely regressed. At the age of five years and six months, a third episode of left peripheral facial palsy occurred. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was repeated, showing gliotic evolution of the previous haemorrhagic insult without new lesions.

{"note": "A six and half year old boy referred to us from another center had complaints of an insidious onset of pain in his right forearm, which initially was less intense. The parents ignored it initially thinking it might be due to his excessive playful nature and cycling. They had a delay of three and half months to consult a doctor in their town when the child complained of an increasing pain. In the meantime, there appeared some swelling in his forearm, which was gradually progressing. A X-ray was done () which revealed an expansile lytic lesion in the proximal half of the radius. He was initially kept under observation and was then referred to a higher center. A repeat X-ray was done, which revealed an expansile lytic lesion involving the proximal half of the radius. On comparing the previous X-rays (), it was seen that the lesion had significantly increased in size with thinning of the cortex rendering it difficult to decide the treatment options. As per the protocol, an MRI was done (–) which revealed low to intermediate signal intensity with a rim of low signal intensity with internal septa. A bone biopsy was done which after radiological correlation was confirmed to be a case of aneurysmal bone cyst.\nThe tumor was expansile with papery thin cortices and hence was not amenable to curettage. It was decided to do wide resection of the tumor. Reconstruction of the radius following tumor resection can be done with different techniques. First to use child’s own fibula may be considered as vascularized or nonvascularized pattern. Second, the cadaveric allograft. Third, an allogenic allograft from the mother. The parents were informed regarding all the options for reconstructing the radius following excision of the tumor. We were a bit concerned with regard to the diameter of child’s own fibula to be used with the radius because of the possible size mismatch as well as the surgical trauma at two sites.

Blood sample investigation revealed mild leucocytosis with PRC augmentation and normal AST, ALT and bilirubin levels. Preoperative ultrasound revealed thickened gallbladder wall suggestive of acute cholecystitis. She has had previous sigmoid resection for diverticulitis and ERCP for choledocholithiasis without any mention of biliary abnormality. She was scheduled for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy during which the incidental intraoperative finding of a left sided gallbladder was made. Standard trocar positions were used (A) without any variation of technique, simply following the Strasberg criteria for safe cholecystectomy []. Having seen the anatomical variation (B), a careful dissection of Calot’s triangle was carried out, the cystic duct and artery were identified and isolated, and subsequent complete dissection of the gallbladder from the liver was done (C). This manoeuvre allowed us to demonstrate a right sided positioning of the cystic duct. Furthermore, a safe clipping and transection of the cystic duct and artery was achieved (D), and the gallbladder was extracted in an endobag. The postoperative course was complicated by an aggravation of diabetes and basal pneumonia which were controlled postoperatively in the intensive unit. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 16, in good condition. Retrospective analysis of the clinical case was done and a previous CT scan was reevaluated. Even with the knowledge of a left sided gallbladder, the CT scan was unable to demonstrate its attachment to the left side of the liver. This was probably due to the presence of a hypertrophic left lobe mimicking only a contiguity with the gallbladder, which itself appeared to be in a physiological position (). A vascular and biliary reconstruction was then evaluated with evidence of agenesis of the right anterior sector of the liver () with the absence of the right hepatic duct and an intrahepatic variation with insertion of the right inferior sectorial duct into the left common duct () as type A3 of Huang Classification []."}

The patient had been under nephrological follow up since adolescence, when she was incidentally discovered to have mild renal impairment (Fig. ). An intravenous pyelogram performed at the time showed that both kidneys were small with decreased cortical thickness and the most likely diagnosis was felt to be chronic pyelonephritis. Ultrasound scanning confirmed small kidneys with no overt renal cysts observed; urinalysis was consistently bland. She had also been investigated for symptoms of marked tiredness as a teenager and was found to be anaemic with a haemoglobin value of approximately 90 g/L. This was felt to be out of keeping with her level of kidney function at the time and remained unexplained despite extensive investigation. She developed gout in her twenties and her serum uric acid level was measured at 550 μmol/L; treatment with allopurinol was initiated. She remained under renal follow up and her kidney function continued to slowly deteriorate. Her haemoglobin level remained stable at around 100 g/L after initial treatment with iron and later an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA). When she was aged 37 years, one of the nephrology team noted that her mother had recently commenced haemodialysis. As both mother and daughter had presented with slowly progressive CKD, bland urinary sediment and small kidneys on renal imaging, the most likely diagnosis was now felt to be ADTKD.\nA detailed family history revealed that the patient’s maternal grandmother had been told she had small kidneys but no further clinical details were available (Fig. ).

Physical examination revealed that the patient had tachycardia at rest and hepatomegaly and no other significant findings. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed clear lung fields and mildly enlarged heart. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen revealed few cysts in the liver without any associated lymphadenopathy in the coeliac group of lymph nodes. As part of the workup, the patient had a CT scan of the abdomen, chest, and brain. The CT showed one cyst in the heart, four cysts in the liver, but no cysts in the lungs or the brain (Figures -).\nThe cystic nature of the lesions and their locations in multiple organs made us think of the HC as the pathology. The serology test for HC using the ELISA test came positive, which helped to confirm the diagnosis. The patient was scheduled for urgent open-heart surgery, fearing the risk of potential rupture of the cyst and the grave consequences which come with that. The patient underwent conventional median sternotomy and aortocaval cannulation with aortic cross-clamp and cardioplegic heart arrest. CT images helped to locate the cardia cyst and its relation to the cardiac chambers. The location of the cyst was confirmed by direct examination of the heart when it was arrested. The cyst was totally located intramurally in the interventricular septum and expanding down mostly to the left side of the diaphragmatic surface of the heart and partly crossing intramurally to the diaphragmatic surface of the right ventricle making a visible and palpable soft cystic bulge. The myocardium overlying the cyst on the left side of the posterior descending coronary artery on the diaphragmatic surface of the heart was fibrosed, making part of the ectocyst wall.

She reported a history of injuring her right foot when playing sport for 30 years. She when landing recalled that she had twisted her right foot; moreover, the foot was not well treated at that time of the injury. The only treatment for the fifth toe was with the temporary bandage to reduce the deformity. Then, the PIP joint of the fifth toe was redislocated for several times in 6 months after the first injury and the same treatment was attempted each time. After that, the fifth toe gradually became permanently swollen and painful on movement. When the patient presented in the out patient clinic with chronic right fifth toe pain and swelling, (Figure ), the toe was displaced in the dorsolateral plane. The plain radiograph showed a simple dislocation of PIP joint in the dorsolateral direction. The articular cartilage of middle phalanx impinged on the lateral condyle of proximal phalanx. There was no indication of definite joint destruction, erosion or unhealed fracture (Figure ). The distal segment of the toes was unstable because of the chronic and persistent joint subluxation.\nThe decision was made to attempt the correction of the chronic dislocation by open reduction, as the problem had been present for many years and all previous attempts at closed reduction had been non-successful. The dislocated PIP joint was exposed via a dorsal incision, revealing that the joint capsule and attenuated lateral collateral ligament were interposed within the PIP joint space, and the articular cartilage at lateral condyle of proximal phalanx of the fifth toe became eroded (Figure ). The joint capsule and the lateral collateral ligament were dissected away from the joint space. The tight plantar plate was released from plantar lateral aspect of the joint and the corrected position of the PIP joint was maintained by inserting a longitudinal Kirschner wire.

He also experienced syncope 2 months prior to admission to our hospital and intermittent chest pain for 2 weeks leading up to admission. The patient had a past medical history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He had been diagnosed with moderate AS 4 years ago and followed up regularly with checkups in the outpatient clinic, and the patient had been prescribed irbesartan, amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, atorvastatin. On admission his blood pressure and pulse rate were 150/70 mm Hg and 78/min, while body weight and height were 53 kg and 172 cm. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showed sinus rhythm with intermittent premature atrial complexes and findings suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy with strain signs on lateral leads. Cardiomegaly was noted on the chest X-ray. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed severe degenerative change of aortic valve with heavy calcification (). The aortic valve area was 0.76 cm2 with a mean systolic pressure gradient of 43 mm Hg and peak systolic pressure gradient of 79 mm Hg compatible with severe AS. The aorta diameter was 21 mm at the aortic annulus, 32 mm at the sinus of valsalva, and 36 mm in the ascending aorta. Left ventricular end diastolic diameter was 52 mm and ejection fraction was 67%. There was mild pulmonary hypertension with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 38 mm Hg. Coronary angiography showed mild coronary artery disease with 50% stenosis at the mid left anterior descending segment. Computed tomography showed diffuse atherosclerotic change of aorta and both external iliac arteries with calcification. The minimal lumen diameter of right and left external iliac arteries was 6 mm and 7 mm, respectively. A pulmonary function test revealed mild obstructive airway disease.

{"note": "A 66-year-old man, who had been undergoing hemodialysis for years, was referred for the creation of a proper long-term dialysis access. He had multiple AVFs in both upper extremities that had failed previously and was currently on dialysis through a left femoral vein double-lumen catheter. He had a right lung empyema a month ago and was still undergoing drainage and appropriate antibiotic treatment. Because of the history of empyema, which increases the risk of infection in AVG, we decided to implant an AVF in the upper extremity again. Ultrasound mapping was performed for the patient in the operating room without tourniquet application to examine the basilic and brachial veins in both limbs. The basilic vein was thrombosed previously, but in the left upper limb, the brachial veins were open and the medial vein was 3 mm and joined by the axillary vein in the higher part of the upper arm. The paired brachial vein diameter was also 3 mm. Therefore, we planned the surgery to transpose the left medial brachial vein. BrVT was performed under local anesthesia with sedation with three skip incisions in the medial arm. Initially, a 4-cm horizontal skin incision was made distally in the arm to explore the brachial artery and vein. Then, the lateral branches were found and separated along the brachial vein. The connections between the two brachial veins were divided by simple sutures. The main difficulty with the restricted incision was to obtain proper exposure and this was resolved by cutting the brachial vein in the cubital part and changing its direction in different views. In the second stage, another 4-cm incision was made horizontally in the middle of the arm. The lateral branches of the brachial vein were carefully explored and separated from the lateral incisions at intervals between skin incisions. Finally, by incision of the skin across the hairline in the axillary area, the brachial vein was explored and released from the elbow level. The vein was transposed anteriorly in a superficial tunnel and re-anastomosed higher up"}
{"note": "A 25-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department after falling off his bicycle. He was hit by the bicycle's handle bar into the left side of the abdomen. The clinical examination revealed a fit young man who had only a scratch (abrasion) on the abdominal wall left of the umbilicus. Hemodynamically he was normal and alert and referred to intense pain at the abrasion site. The abdomen was soft, without signs of peritoneal irritation while sensitivity was only at the point of the abrasion. Laboratory tests, including white blood cells, liver enzymes, and amylase, were normal. The abdominal X-ray in upright (standing) position did not reveal the presence of free intraperitoneal air. Abdominal ultrasound did not reveal any solid abdominal organ injury nor the presence of free intraperitoneal fluid. The pain was attributed to hematoma of the rectus abdominis muscle pricey below the abrasion which was revealed by ultrasound.\nThe pain of the young man was gradually worsening and was mostly described diffusely throughout the whole abdomen. The abdomen remained soft and tender without signs of peritoneal irritation. We proceeded to the administration of per os contrast material and CT abdomen. The CT scan revealed the presence of sufficient amount of free intraperitoneal contrast but did not allow the clarification of the exact point of escape. The free contrast material was detected at the left side of the abdomen, at the area of the descending colon but mainly in the pelvis (). The intraluminal contrast had even reached up the level of the transverse colon.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy immediately after the CT scan (4 hours after the arrival at the emergency department and about 4.5 hours after the time of injury). Intraoperatively, fecal peritonitis due to isolated rupture of jejunum 30 cm from the ligament of Treitz was revealed. The rupture was at the center of an extensive jejunum serous layer fissure giving the picture of “blow out” perforation. At the jejunal mesentery there was minimal bru"}

At the time of hospitalization, she was in treatment with verapamil 120 mg daily and warfarin for persistent atrial fibrillation. A complete list of medicine at the time of hospitalization is available in Table .\nThe patient had recently had a gastroscopy revealing a fungal infection and a high level of gastric acid. Her family physician therefore initiated a treatment with a short course of fluconazole and pantoprazole. After 2 days of treatment with fluconazole, her physician measured an INR of 5.6. After a control visit 2 days later, the INR had increased to eight and the patient was hospitalized.\nAt the time of hospitalization, her heart rate was 96 bpm. During the evening on the third day of hospitalization, an electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation and a junior physician prescribed Selo-zok® (metoprolol), 50 mg slow-release tablet. According to the latest guideline from the European Society of Cardiology, a patient in need of acute rhythm control can have digoxin added to the treatment with verapamil, if the patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction of above 40 and the heart rate is above 110 bpm. The patient was not known with previous heart failure or reduced ventricular ejection fraction, and a suspicion of heart failure was not mentioned in the hospital records at this time. The next morning an experienced doctor discontinued metoprolol during the morning rounds, as she was aware of a potential interaction between metoprolol and verapamil. The patient was well and had no signs of acute illnesses. Only one tablet of metoprolol 50 mg had been administered to the patient.

The patient presented with a 7-month history of progressively enlarging mass on her left ring finger. The patient mentioned that the mass appeared suddenly with no history of trauma and that she was concerned about the potential malignant nature of the mass. The patient also mentioned that she underwent incision and drainage of that mass 2 months after its appearance with no improvement and provided no detailed surgical or pathological reports, which was the reason for her delayed presentation. Upon her assessment, the mass was located over the ulnar side of the proximal phalanx of left ring finger with extensive involvement of the 4th web space. The overlying skin coverage was ulcerative with no active signs of infection. Range of motion of the involved digit was limited, however neurovascular examination was normal. ().\nRadiological evaluation of the involved hand showed a soft tissue swelling with no evidence of bone involvement (). Further magnetic resonant (MRI) evaluation showed a mass on the volar aspect of the ring finger encasing about 50% of the flexor tendons of that digit with low signal intensity on T1 and high signal intensity on T2 evaluation with strong enhancement in post contrast evaluation. Assessment of neurovascular structures showed partial abutment of the radial sided bundle together with complete encirclement of the ulnar sided neurovascular bundle. The surrounding bone was free of any masses and associated mass effect.\nThe patient was taken to the OR for exploration and mass excision by the senior author. Possible risks associated with such intervention were explained. Intra-operatively, bruner type incision was designed together with island of skin involved in the mass.

In his medical history, he had hypertension for 4 years but no history of trauma. A physical examination showed the presence of palpable pulsatile masses in his both axillae (12 cm in size in the right axilla and 8 cm in size in the left axilla) (Fig. ). His neurological and systemic examinations were within normal limits. An upper-extremity ultrasound examination revealed an aneurysm in a 12-cm segment of the right axillary artery, reaching 67 × 45 mm in dimension. There was a 27-mm thick thrombus at the edge of the aneurysm lumen. Adjacent to the aneurysm, there was a 48 × 40 mm hyperechogenic mass not related to the aneurysm. There was also an aneurysm reaching 40 × 43 mm in dimension in a 9-cm segment of the left axillary artery, with a 17-mm thick thrombus. A Doppler ultrasonic examination revealed a thrombus surrounding the lumen and a turbulent, pulsatile flow in the center. The aneurysmal segment was continuous with the brachial artery. There was no blood flow in the region adjacent to the right axillary artery (Figs. and ). On CT angiography, giant fusiform aneurysms were detected, measuring 140 × 77 mm in the right axillary artery and 93 × 45 mm in the left axillary artery. There were thrombi in both aneurysms, allowing the flow in the lumen. There was also an extension to the brachial artery and contour irregularities at the distal end of the right-side aneurysm. These latter findings were proposed to be due to a spontaneously healed rupture. A physical examination of the eyes, bones, skin and joints revealed no signs of collagen tissue disease, nor was it detected through laboratory examinations.

He then underwent nephrectomy for a 7 × 6 × 5.5 cm tumor extending though the fascia into the perinephric fat. He did well until March of 2006 when he had a routine chest X-ray that showed new lung nodules and a CT scan was ordered. A large retroperitoneal mass posterior to the stomach measuring 10 × 9 × 8 cm was also found along with bilateral lung nodules, with the largest lung lesion measuring 2 cm. Biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass confirmed RCC. MRI of the brain and bone scan was negative. He was seen for the first time at our institution in April of 2006. He was determined to be a candidate for high-dose IL-2 (600,000 IU/kg). After 8 weeks, he did show some response, but was only able to tolerate half of cycle 2 and he declined further IL-2. He was then started on sorafenib and had a minor response at all disease sites until CT scan in January 2007 after 24 weeks showed progression. He was then switched to sunitinib 50 mg daily for 4 weeks of a 6 weeks cycles, and after 12 weeks on therapy had a significant response which he enjoyed until week 54 when CT scanning showed marked disease progression.

After about a month, she noticed acute onset weakness in raising her left arm above the shoulder. The weakness progressed over a day to involve the entire left limb and she was unable to flex her elbow or grip objects.

Blood sample investigation revealed mild leucocytosis with PRC augmentation and normal AST, ALT and bilirubin levels. Preoperative ultrasound revealed thickened gallbladder wall suggestive of acute cholecystitis. She has had previous sigmoid resection for diverticulitis and ERCP for choledocholithiasis without any mention of biliary abnormality. She was scheduled for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy during which the incidental intraoperative finding of a left sided gallbladder was made. Standard trocar positions were used (A) without any variation of technique, simply following the Strasberg criteria for safe cholecystectomy []. Having seen the anatomical variation (B), a careful dissection of Calot’s triangle was carried out, the cystic duct and artery were identified and isolated, and subsequent complete dissection of the gallbladder from the liver was done (C). This manoeuvre allowed us to demonstrate a right sided positioning of the cystic duct. Furthermore, a safe clipping and transection of the cystic duct and artery was achieved (D), and the gallbladder was extracted in an endobag. The postoperative course was complicated by an aggravation of diabetes and basal pneumonia which were controlled postoperatively in the intensive unit. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 16, in good condition. Retrospective analysis of the clinical case was done and a previous CT scan was reevaluated. Even with the knowledge of a left sided gallbladder, the CT scan was unable to demonstrate its attachment to the left side of the liver. This was probably due to the presence of a hypertrophic left lobe mimicking only a contiguity with the gallbladder, which itself appeared to be in a physiological position ().

She experienced almost daily episodes of hives that would last less than a day and were intensely pruritic. Prior to presentation in our clinic, she was treated by several physicians with various combinations of high dose first and second generation antihistamines without success. Montelukast offered no benefit when added to treatment with antihistamines. However, relief was obtainable with oral prednisone (20 mg/day) or cyclosporine (200 mg daily in divided doses). A biopsy was obtained which confirmed the diagnosis of true urticaria and ruled out urticarial vasculitis. During the course of her work up, a number of laboratory tests were ordered and were unrevealing as to the potential etiology of her hives (Table ). She noted no association of symptoms with food or medications. Despite frequent monitoring, she was fearful of the potential toxic effects from cyclosporine after she experienced a transient decrease in renal function of unknown significance. Additionally, she was intolerant of prednisone when used at times in place of cyclosporine due weight gain and psychosis. In an effort to find a more tolerable and effective alternative, treatment was initiated with omalizumab 300 mg every two weeks. This dose was chosen based upon the severity of her symptoms and previous successful outcomes []. After the first treatment with omalizumab, the patient noted significant improvement. Over the course of the subsequent 2 weeks, she was able to wean cyclosporine down to 25 mg daily without experiencing an urticarial flare. This was the lowest tolerable dose required to prevent flares until the eighth treatment visit at which time she was able to completely withdraw from cyclosporine use.

A plain radiograph was taken () and it showed moth eaten both osteolytic and osteosclerotic lesions in the left distal femoral metaphysis. But there was no periosteal reaction or no cortical destruction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed T1 low and T2 heterogenous signal intensity intramedullary lesion in the metaphysis which had not crossed the growth plate and no definite cortical destruction was also identified (). A radiologist reported that this case was consistent with an osteosarcoma but the possibility of benign lesion could not be excluded.

However, mucosal necrosis was not found (Fig. ). Since her symptoms were slight and temporary, she remained on conservative treatments at that time. Her abdominal pain became worse; melena occurred often during the course of her conservative treatments, and these symptoms occurred when blood pressure became low under hemodialysis. Then, she was referred to our hospital for further evaluation of her recurrent ischemic colitis. Computed tomography (CT) scans showed chronic B-AD, which extended from the distal anastomotic part of the total arch graft to both common iliac arteries. The distal re-entry size was 26 mm. The expanded false lumen compressed the true lumen of most of the aorta, including the origin of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) (Fig. ).\nBased on these clinical findings, we considered that this recurrent ischemic colitis was a result of diminished blood flow to the SMA due to the compressed true lumen combined with hypotension due to hemodialysis. We then determined that therapeutic enlargement of the true lumen would improve blood flow to the SMA and reduce the risk of ischemic colitis. For treatment, we decided to perform TEVAR because open surgical repair can be risky for the patient considering the history of previous Bentall operation and comorbid ESRF. Because the patient’s quality of life was adversely affected by"}

In spite of living independently at home, he was noted to have dementia with significant cognitive impairment.\nThe patient was a vague historian and was unable to give sufficient details regarding the genesis or duration of the wound. He stated the ulcer might have been present for two weeks and had occurred subsequent to a fall. No further information regarding the cause of the ulcer could be elicited. His GP had treated the ulcer unsuccessfully with a one-week course of antibiotics prior to presentation. On examination, the patient was noted to be malnourished and cachectic with significant lower limb oedema. Mini Mental State Examination on review was 12/30. Circumferential ulceration of the left lower leg was noted (). The wound was approximately 2 cm wide and extended through the fascia throughout the wound. There was a large burden of tenacious slough, obscuring the base of the wound. The presence of larval infestation was identified. The wound was dressed, antibiotics were commenced, and the patient was transferred to a tertiary referral hospital for review and management by the vascular surgery and geriatric medicine teams.\nThe patient was reviewed in the emergency department of the tertiary hospital where the wound was inspected before transfer to the ward. A plain radiograph of the area of concern noted a soft tissue defect with no bony abnormality. On review of the wound by the admitting team, the peculiar morphology of the ulcer was noted. The uniform circumferential nature of the wound resembled that of a ligature type injury. Additional questioning however revealed no further clues to elucidate the causative mechanism. The patient denied any process that could adequately explain the circular nature of the lesion. A management plan of elevation, compression, antibiotics, and a dressing regime with the aim of eventual grafting was commenced.\nThe wound was debrided on the ward,"}

Various soft tissue nodules had been present for multiple years; however, during the last few weeks prior to the initial evaluation, she developed an alarming increased number of widespread soft-tissue masses with significant tenderness in comparison. Her daily activities are often interrupted due to the menacing symptoms, causing significant attrition to her quality of life. Multiple attempts of over-the-counter trials of pain medications have failed to provide the patent with any relief and prescription pain medications are but a bandage for her illness. The patient has a significant past medical history including obesity (BMI 35), chronic atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, hypertension, and sick sinus syndrome status post atrial pacemaker placement.\nDuring the initial presentation, ultrasound examination revealed hyperechoic foci in the subcutaneous tissues that were circumscribed without any Doppler flow, consistent with lipomas. The patient then underwent excision of multiple back nodules to further characterize the lesions, revealing a gross pathology report of adipose tissue with nodularity. An interesting point to note is that the rate at which new palpable nodules developed was intriguing. She developed four new identifiable lesions in various parts of the body in the short interval between her office visit and the date of the operation. Histopathology reports one of four specimens demonstrating portions of mature adipose tissue consistent with lipoma, and three of four specimens with mature adipocytes and branching network of small vessels consistent with angiolipoma.\nShe was seen in the postoperative period with a continued manifestation of these subcutaneous nodules throughout her body. The pain along the sites of excised lesions had improved but she continues to have significant tenderness along the areas of new masses.

The mass was painless and gradually increasing in size. The family members of this patient brought her to a traditional healer. They did not seek any medical treatment until late 2017. By this time, the mass over the sacrum was extremely large. Family members claimed the mass was preventing the patient from lying down flat supine. The patient was also unable to ambulate for the past 2 years. Hence, she was bedbound most of the time. It was difficult for her to sit on the wheelchair. She also felt tired to move because the mass was quite heavy. The family members claimed when the patient was lying down flat, she had to flex her hips and knees to achieve a more comfortable position. In addition, she often slept either in prone position or in supine with multiple pillows below her body. The mother also claimed over the last 2 months, the patient’s body had been getting thinner despite her physical weight was increasing due to the increase in size of the sacral mass. The patient had been passing stool and urine in pampers. There was no past medical history and no family history of cancer. Socially, the patient lived with her mother and siblings.

He denied any history of other skin lesion or swelling in the neck. He has no history of smoking, alcohol consumption, or sun exposure. On physical examination, the lesion was an ulcerative measuring approximately 3 × 3 cm. There was no palpable cervical lymphadenopathy. No pre- or postauricular lymphadenopathy. No other suspicious skin lesions of the face or the neck were found. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. Head and neck computerized tomography (CT scan) did not show any evidence of pathologic lymph nodes or masses. Staging with CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was also negative for metastatic disease. The patient underwent complete local excision and split-thickness skin graft. Histopathology assessment revealed skin tissue infiltrated by neoplastic growth composed of tubules, cords, and nests of malignant cells. The extensive perineural invasion was seen. There was no lymphovascular invasion. The resection margins were clear. The pathology confirmed an apocrine cutaneous carcinoma [see ]. The case was reviewed in the head and neck tumor board and the decision of no adjuvant treatment. 1.5 years later, the patient presented to the combined head and neck oncology clinic with right neck lymphadenopathy for the last few weeks.

Intra-oral examination revealed a white to blackish elevated lesion on the right buccal mucosa in the second and third molar region measuring about 4x5 cm in size. An extra-oral swelling was also evident, which appeared normal in color but was tender on palpation. During elicitation of detailed history from the patient, it was revealed that patient was tobacco chewer since last 20 years and had leukoplakia patch on the right buccal mucosa. An incisional biopsy was advised for the leukoplakia at a private dental hospital. However, immediately after the local infiltration into the buccal mucosa, the patient complained of severe pain and burning sensation at the site of injection. On investigation of the local anesthetic bottle, it was found that 2 to 3 cc of 10% formalin was injected accidently, as both solutions were stored in similar containers. Formalin container was placed on the operating table for fixation and transport of the biopsy sample. After recording the case history, administration of 2 mL dexamethasone injection, in and around the lesion, was one of the immediate measures taken to reduce inflammation. The extra-oral swelling was noted to increase progressively for the first 24 h, though pain reduced over a period of time. The patient was kept under strict supervision and monitored for any adverse cardiac or pulmonary event for 48 h. Medications prescribed included injection dexamethasone 8 mg twice a day (tapering doses: 8 mg once a day for 2 days and 4 mg once a day for 2 days), injection diclofenac sodium thrice a day to reduce pain, injection taxim 1 gm twice a day for 5 days, injection metronidazole 400 mg thrice a day for 5 days and oral rinses with 2% betadine solution to avoid development of any local infection.

The patient shows a high risk for caries and also eccentric bruxism. He has partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant and multiple decay and fractured teeth. The initial approach was conservative aiming to keep the upper front by means of composite fillings (Figures and ). Then, the posterior superior quadrants needed to be restored with implants.\nThree years after, in 2017, the patient came back to the office referring pain of endodontic origin in the upper left canine. New and secondary subgingival caries were found in the six front teeth. The conservative prognosis was considered poor due to the subgingival depth and extent of decay presented by the lesions from canine to canine. After having discussed the treatment options, especially the surgical lengthening of the front teeth or the orthodontic extrusion, the patient decides to replace the residual teeth with a new implant-supported bridge similar to the recently performed prostheses of the posterior areas that were judged by him as a highly satisfactory treatment. The patient preferred not to involve these restorations in the present anterior treatment and limited it to place only two implants in the lateral incisors' positions ().\nThe treatment was carried out in a staged approach. Briefly, first, we extracted the lateral incisors, using the SST, and placed two immediate implants. The four residual teeth were then prepared to be used as abutments of a temporary bridge for the purpose of maintaining the aesthetics and function of the patient during the early osseointegration period. In a further step, the four remaining teeth were also extracted using the SST, and the initial provisional bridge was replaced by the second provisional screwed on the uncovered implants. Only one out of the four abutment teeth used for the temporization of root canal treatment was needed due to a periapical infection.\nWhen placing the two"}

History of the present illness revealed pain and discharge from the palate for 2 months. Pain was insidious in onset, dull, gnawing, intermittent in nature, lasts for hours, and relived on its own. Pain was associated with discharge. There was no history of paresthesia or anesthesia in the region of area of interest. Past medical history revealed that the patient was a known diabetic for 5 years and not on any medications. Past dental history revealed that the patient reported to a local dentist 2 months ago with tender swelling of gums and loosening of teeth. The condition was diagnosed as advanced periodontal disease with severe bone loss and periodontal abscess involving the left maxillary canine. The patient had undergone localized oral prophylaxis followed by extraction of the involved tooth under local anesthesia and oral prophylaxis was later completed. He was advised to maintain good oral hygiene and replacement of missing tooth once the socket heals. Personal history revealed that the patient was a smoker and smoked 2–3 bundles of bidi for 35 years. General examination revealed that he had poor built and nourishment with the presence of pallor and signs of anemia. The patient had submandibular lymphadenopathy without any evidence of tenderness or swelling extraorally. Intraoral examination revealed missing left maxillary canine, generalized signs of severe periodontitis, and exposed necrotic maxillary bone in the palatal area with a necrotizing ulcer.

The initial cervical exam was 2 cm dilation and 50% effacement. Her labor was induced with oxytocin and amniotomy was performed at 5 cm dilation with clear fluid noted. She progressed from 2 cm to 5 cm over the course of 10 hours; interval time to progression to 6 cm was 3.5 hours. The patient then began to have a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding with associated minimal fetal heart rate variability and variable decelerations that did not improve with intrauterine resuscitation. She was taken to the operating room for repeat cesarean delivery due to concern for a uterine rupture and/or a placental abruption. Upon entry into the abdomen, there was no uterine rupture or dehiscence, nor was there evidence of a significant placental abruption. She delivered a male infant with a weight of 2659 g and Apgar scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively; arterial cord pH was 7.26. No extension of the hysterotomy was noted following delivery of the infant. Following repair of the hysterotomy, the bladder was noted to be distended and edematous, despite the presence of a patent Foley catheter. This finding prompted a vaginal exam to assist in evaluating the integrity of the lower uterine segment behind the bladder due to concern for an occult uterine rupture or dehiscence. The vaginal exam revealed a spontaneous detachment of the anterior rim of the cervix from approximately 9 to 3 o'clock. The avulsed portion of cervix appeared necrotic () and there was no bleeding noted at the site of cervical detachment.

In his medical history, he had hypertension for 4 years but no history of trauma. A physical examination showed the presence of palpable pulsatile masses in his both axillae (12 cm in size in the right axilla and 8 cm in size in the left axilla) (Fig. ). His neurological and systemic examinations were within normal limits. An upper-extremity ultrasound examination revealed an aneurysm in a 12-cm segment of the right axillary artery, reaching 67 × 45 mm in dimension. There was a 27-mm thick thrombus at the edge of the aneurysm lumen. Adjacent to the aneurysm, there was a 48 × 40 mm hyperechogenic mass not related to the aneurysm. There was also an aneurysm reaching 40 × 43 mm in dimension in a 9-cm segment of the left axillary artery, with a 17-mm thick thrombus. A Doppler ultrasonic examination revealed a thrombus surrounding the lumen and a turbulent, pulsatile flow in the center. The aneurysmal segment was continuous with the brachial artery. There was no blood flow in the region adjacent to the right axillary artery (Figs. and ). On CT angiography, giant fusiform aneurysms were detected, measuring 140 × 77 mm in the right axillary artery and 93 × 45 mm in the left axillary artery. There were thrombi in both aneurysms, allowing the flow in the lumen. There was also an extension to the brachial artery and contour irregularities at the distal end of the right-side aneurysm. These latter findings were proposed to be due to a spontaneously healed rupture. A physical examination of the eyes, bones, skin and joints revealed no signs of collagen tissue disease, nor was it detected through laboratory examinations. Because the patient was symptomatic and had a high risk of aneurysm rupture, endovascular closure was initially planned. However, appropriate size stents could not be found for aneurysms so large and tortuous. Besides, the"}

He began to gradually develop fullness and a lump in the midline of his forehead over the frontal sinus region. Sinus plain radiographs demonstrated ‘sinusitis’ for which he was referred to an otolaryngologist who arranged a paranasal sinus CT scan. This scan demonstrated a bone destructive lesion of the frontal sinus. A further MRI scan confirmed the presence of a frontal sinus tumour without intracranial extension or extension into the ethmoid bone. The tumour was limited to the lower two-thirds and anterior wall of the frontal sinus with obstructive changes in the superior part of the right frontal sinus. Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the lesion revealed a squamous cell carcinoma. He was otherwise fit and well barring mild hyperlipidemia. He has no family history of sinus cancer and did not take any medications. He did not smoke but drank alcohol two to three times a week.\nOn examination there was a poorly-defined smooth swelling approximately 4 cm in width on the forehead in the midline just about the eyebrows. There was normal skin sensation on the forehead bilaterally and no cranial nerve abnormalities. No other palpable masses were present in the head and neck. Otolaryngological examination was normal. There were no other abnormalities detected on general examination.

As it was not possible to remove the mandibular foreign body from the root canal at the referral dentist, she was admitted to get it removed using a surgical approach. During the intraoral clinical examination, there was an access cavity filled with a temporary filling material and the tooth was sensitive to pressure. There was tenderness in the apical portion of the tooth. A panoramic radiograph obtained at the initial visit after the patient referral revealed a well-defined fractured instrument lying in the mandible beyond the apical foramen of her right mandibular premolar tooth. Moreover, computed tomography (CT) images revealed that the fractured segment was located within the mandibular bone (Fig. ). A diagnosis of migration of a broken endodontic instrument beyond the apical foramen into the mandible was made, and surgery was considered necessary to eliminate the symptoms. The decision was made to proceed with the surgery because of increasing pain.\nSurgical intervention was required to find the apical root cutting-edge lesion and the broken dental instrument through a small bony window and to remove it from the oral cavity by pushing up in order to reliably preserve the tooth for restorative treatment. Therefore, we decided to use three-dimensional navigation-guided surgery for its minimally invasive nature and high surgical accuracy. As it is difficult to synchronize with the preoperative imaging data during surgery due to the mobile nature of the mandible, we used a customized interocclusal splint for repeatable mandibular positioning while enabling surgical access. As part of the CT imaging preparation for navigation, a customized interocclusal splint was fabricated by pressing acrylic resin into a dental mold at the first visit. First, the created bimaxillary upper and lower jaw splints were adhered using resin at"}

The mass had been present for at least 2 years, and the breast was swollen, streaked with grey and blue, and mildly tender. There was no personal or family history of breast cancer. Her past medical history was significant for a hysterectomy and oophorectomy at 46 years of age. Her first menstrual period was at age 13, and she had never been pregnant.\nPhysical exam revealed a well-nourished female with an obvious mass of the right breast. The mass measured 36 × 30 cm at the time of presentation. The skin of the breast was blue at the apex of the mass, and the nipple was massively enlarged and excoriated (Fig ). On initial presentation, there was no evidence of skin breakdown, but by the time of surgery, the patient had experienced loss of skin integrity. The contralateral breast was of normal size, with no significant masses on palpation. There was no palpable adenopathy in either of the axillary basins.\nFine needle aspiration was performed during the initial visit and revealed highly atypical cells suspicious of a malignant neoplasm. Core tissue biopsy showed mixed epithelial-stromal proliferation suggestive of a phyllodes tumor. CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and head showed no evidence of distant metastasis but did suggest invasion of the tumor into the chest wall. For this reason, initial surgical management only involved tumor resection, and breast reconstruction was deferred.\nRight simple mastectomy was performed. Superior and inferior skin flaps were designed to allow skin approximation and closure after removal of the large tumor. These flaps included skin directly overlying the tumor that appeared normal (Fig ). The superior flap was raised to the level of the clavicle. Dissection revealed that the blood supply to the tumor was derived largely from collateral vessels arising from the skin. These vessels were large and friable, yet easily managed using standard techniques. The inferior flap was then raised, demonstrating tumor that"}

She had suffered with recurrent urinary tract infections for most of her childhood and adult life but was otherwise well with no other major co-morbidities or risk factors for colorectal malignancy and had no family history of colorectal disease.\nColonoscopy revealed two large sessile polyps in the sigmoid colon in close proximity to each other and adjacent to a diverticulum-like structure (Fig. ). Each polyp was approximately 3 cm in size and both exhibited a type IV pit pattern with areas of irregularity suggestive of focally advanced disease. Histological examination confirmed both polyps were adenomas comprising both low and high grade dysplasia, without submucosal invasion (Fig. ). On closer inspection the mucosa around the diverticulum was also atypical but not adenomatous. The remainder of the colonoscopy was unremarkable with no other evidence of diverticular disease or polyps elsewhere.\nEndoscopic resection was considered as a therapeutic option however in view of the above characteristics as well as difficult endoscopic access surgery was preferred. Furthermore, radiological imaging had initially raised the possibility of invasive disease in view of sigmoid thickening. The patient underwent high anterior resection and an open approach was chosen because of suspected intra-abdominal adhesions following extensive pelvic surgery. An end colostomy was formed at the patient’s pre-operative request. At laparotomy the right fallopian tube was adherent to the sigmoid colon and adjacent to this a blind ending tube was noted to emerge from the anti-mesenteric border of the colon.

At 7 and at 14 years of age surgical resection of the membrane was performed. As a young adult, she developed recurrent severe subvalvular stenosis which became symptomatic. When she was 21 years old, the membrane was radically resected through a Morrow procedure and the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract was widened with a Konno procedure. After this operation she was symptom-free and needed no medication. Her echocardiogram demonstrated septal akinesia with an LV diastolic diameter of 57 mm at the basal level but a normal midventricular diameter of 52 mm. LV ejection fraction was 50%. The aortic valve was abnormal with grade I regurgitation and valvular aortic stenosis with peak and mean gradients of 27 and 15 mmHg. It was concluded that she had a slightly elevated risk of heart failure and arrhythmias during pregnancy because of her mild aortic valve dysfunction and local wall motion abnormality of the LV. She was graded as pregnancy risk WHO class II [–] (low-moderate risk). She became pregnant in 2007 and was followed in the cardiac service at 20, 26 and 34 weeks. Her LV diameters and ejection fraction as well as the aortic stenosis and regurgitation were stable. She developed dyspnoea on exertion during the second trimester without signs of heart failure, which was attributed to the pregnancy in combination with moderate overweight. During the last weeks of pregnancy she started to gain weight, a total of 8 kg in 2 weeks time, and she felt more dyspnoeic. The patient, a medical doctor herself, suggested that she had fluid retention due to heart failure, but the junior gynaecologist assured her that this weight gain was normal and the cardiologist was not consulted.

{"note": "In March 2012, a 37-year-old, previously healthy woman started with essential right trigeminal neuralgia. Though pharmacological treatment was started, the patient did not improve. After one year of treatment, she presented with skin lesions on the face, along the areas innervated by the ipsilateral V cranial nerve. The patient was exhaustively studied, including an assessment by multiple specialists. Herpes and other infectious and dermatological diseases were ruled out by performing a biopsy of the skin and a pathology assessment. The lesions were increasing in size and were located in areas innervated by the three branches of right cranial nerve V. The lesions were painless and related to the longest period of painful symptoms (Figure ). In July 2013, she underwent a Fogarty rhizotomy with no improvement. Subsequently, in January 2014, she underwent right suboccipital decompression with the Janetta microsurgical technique due to the clinical suspicion of vascular compression, without improvement. She continued to present very severe paroxysmal pain crises in the three branches of the right trigeminal daily, which did not respond to any type of treatment and continued with skin lesions. Although the patient did not report repeated manipulations in the innervation zone of the trigeminal nerve, a bandage was used on the face, seeking an improvement in the skin lesions, but the improvement was not as expected. The patient lost weight and when we first evaluated her, she was in a very altered psychological situation, due to both the pain and the expression of the disease on her face.

His symptoms has progressed rapidly over a few weeks. Clinically his symptoms were felt to be consistent with MG. He was admitted to the pediatric ward and reviewed by the anesthetic service. He was maintained under close surveillance but a decision was made to hold off invasive ventilation. He was commenced on ChE-I, oral prednisolone and IVIG. He made good progress and was discharged home with a plan for a further course of IVIG in 4 weeks in his local hospital due the severity of his initial symptoms, and lag time for steroids to take effect. He was seen in clinic 12 months later and at this time was on maximum alternate day steroids. He was also receiving 4-weekly IVIG infusions at his local hospital. Both him and his parents reported a dramatic response to the IVIG but felt the effect wore off after about 3 weeks and his symptoms particularly fatigue became “as bad as ever.” On examination he had no weakness. Prior to his diagnosis he was said to be an outgoing boy and very involved in sports. His parents now reported he was refusing to go to school most days and no longer engaging in any extra-curricular activities. They felt the slightest thing could have him in tears. A decision was made to assess him neurologically at the time of his next infusion. While on the ward strength was noted to be normal and on further questioning he said that he kept reliving his initial hospital admission and felt that the “only reason he didn't die was because of the special protein drip.” He was felt to have evidence of post-traumatic stress disorder and appropriate psychological supports were put in place.

She had been diagnosed with breast cancer two months earlier and had undergone partial mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy. After surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy of three cycles was administered. She had recently developed intermittent abdominal pain. Under physical examination, a diffuse soft mass was palpable with mild tenderness, but the margin of the mass was not clear. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) for evaluating the abdominal pain and mass revealed a giant multi-lobulated mass, measuring 26×12 cm in size, which was adjacent to the lesser curvature of the stomach (). However, the origin of this mass was not determined by CT. The gastrofiberscopic findings revealed a large bulging lesion with intact overlying mucosa on the posterior wall and lesser curvature side of the stomach (). All blood laboratory data values were within normal ranges. Based on the physical examination and the imaging study, we decided to perform exploratory laparotomy after obtaining informed consent from the patient.\nAfter the upper midline incision, a large multi-cystic mass originating from the lesser omentum of the stomach was detected. A portion of the mass adhered to the omentum; this adhesion was easily dissected, but the lesser omentum, including the right and left gastric vessels and the vagus nerves, were fully involved in the mass. The mass appeared to invade the lesser curvature of the gastric antrum. We decided to perform distal gastrectomy with mass excision for curative resection.\nFirst, the gastrohepatic and gastrocolic ligaments were dissected to mobilize the stomach and the mass, and the right gastric vessels were resected.

The initial physical examination revealed a well circumscribed elastic mass measuring about 30 mm not adherent to the underlying tissues or to the skin and no skin or nipple retraction was visible. Besides, the clinical examination did not reveal ipsilateral, axillary, or supraclavicular palpable lymph nodes. Nipple discharge was not evident. Contralateral breast and axilla were normal. The left breast ultrasound showed a cyst measuring 26 mm with irregular and hypoechogenic vegetation growing on the inner wall. A mammographic exam was not performed mostly due to the cystic appearance of the mass. Besides that there are no characteristic findings on mammography specific for this kind of tumours. The patient was submitted to fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the cyst and of the inner vegetation (). The fluid obtained was yellowish and translucent and the size of the mass got reduced after the procedure. The smears were stained with Papanicolaou and May-Grünwald Giemsa stains. Microscopic evaluation revealed some foam cells and epithelial cells without atypia suggesting a benign cystic lesion. The biopsy was not performed since it was a cystic lesion, and, besides the inner vegetation, the whole ultrasonographic features and the FNAC results suggested a benign condition. One month later the breast ultrasound exam showed the persistence of the cyst, with increased volume, measuring about 44 mm maintaining the inner vegetation of 6 × 27 mm, which was irregular in shape and had continuity with the cyst wall (). A surgery was performed because of the cyst rapid growth and ultrasound characteristics. At the time of hospitalization, one month after the second breast ultrasound, the physical examination revealed a painful large mass with 90 mm in the outer quadrants of the left breast.

{"note": "A 74-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for sudden onset of left eyelid ptosis for 1 day with no obvious inducement. The patient had a history of hypertension, but she did not regularly measure blood pressure and take oral antihypertensive drugs. Physical examination revealed that she had clear consciousness and normal speech, but the left eyelid drooped. The left pupil diameter was 5 mm and light reflex was absent. The left eyeball could not move, and the right eye examinations were normal. The limb muscle strength and muscle tension were normal. CTA examination showed bilateral internal carotid artery aneurysms. After admission, the whole cerebral angiography was performed under local anesthesia and the procedure was smooth. The imaging diagnosis was bilateral carotid artery communicating aneurysm combined with severe stenosis of the origin of left carotid artery. The size of the left aneurysm was about 8 mm × 3 mm and the neck was about 3 mm, and the right aneurysm was about 3.7mm × 3.8 mm and the neck was about 3.8 mm (Fig. ). After the operation, when the patient was ready to be lifted down the bed after the angiography, she suddenly became unconscious and could not open her eyes. We found bilateral pupil dilation with a diameter of 5 mm, absence of the light reflex, and there was no reaction to the stabbing pain in the limbs. The patient's emergency head computed tomography (CT) examination showed subarachnoid hemorrhage (Fig. ). The doctor immediately gave the patient intravenous injection of 20% mannitol solution 250 mL. About 15 minutes later, the patient regained consciousness, questions could be answered, and the limbs could move autonomously. We considered the possibility of rupture of the left posterior communicating artery aneurysm. Because of her older age and poor physical general condition of the body, the main worry about the patient was that she might show a poor tolerance to operation and anesthesia. Thus, the patient received conservative treatment.\nOn the third day after operation, the patient's condition gradually"}
{"note": "A 12-year-old boy presented with painful swelling on his left thigh after being kicked by his friend. Plain radiography revealed a concentric cystic lesion with cortical thinning and ballooning in the mid-portion of the femoral shaft accompanied by a pathologic fracture (). The cystic lesion was extensile without a periosteal reaction. The patient underwent curettage of the cystic bone lesion and autogenous bone grafting, followed by open reduction and internal fixation for the pathologic fracture (). Intraoperative biopsy revealed a unicameral bone cyst () and, therefore, it was decided to continue close observation of this case without any further intervention. Two years after surgery, plate removal was performed based on radiographic evidence of complete healing of the cystic bone lesion (). Although 1.5 cm femoral shortening was initially noted after surgery, the leg length discrepancy appeared to have increased with age. Therefore, the patient was scheduled for annual follow-up until skeletal maturity. At the age of 19 years, no recurrence of the cyst was seen on plain radiographs of the femur (), and the final leg length discrepancy was 3.5 cm (). The patient complained of abnormal gait and posture resulting from the 3.5 cm discrepancy, for which lengthening of the shortened femur was planned in the near future.\nAt the age of 20 years, 8 years after the initial surgery, the patient complained of pain in the left thigh. A review of his plain radiographs revealed an impending pathologic fracture caused by a recurrent simple bone cyst in the left femur (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan demonstrated a 6.6 cm × 3 cm × 3 cm-sized, well-defined cystic lesion in the left distal femur (). Comparison of the radiographs and MRI findings revealed the presence of a linear pathologic fracture accompanied by a periosteal reaction. For treatment of the fracture, curettage and autogenous bone grafting combined with internal fixation using an intramedullary nail () were performed. One year after the second surgery, the lesion was stabilized despite cortical thinning and ballooning of the"}

The clinical examination of the asymptomatic patient showed no extra- or intraoral pathological findings. The medical history of the boy included a mild pulmonary valve stenosis and a secundum atrial septal defect with a left-right shunt. He showed a good physical and cardiac fitness and a normal nutritional status. The family history was positive for maxillofacial anomalies: the boy's older sister had been previously diagnosed with a dysplastic fibroma, a rare benign fibrovascular defect in the mandible, and a resection of the affected area in the mandible had been performed. His father and paternal grandmother had a positive history of odontogenic cysts as well as basal cell carcinomas, although the family history of OKCs was negative. The radiological examination showed three suspicious hypomineralisations visible as radiolucencies in the panoramic radiograph associated with the retained teeth 13 and 23 and the ectopic tooth 27 (). The young patient was referred to the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery for a surgical examination of the radiologic anomalies.\nThe operation was performed under general anesthesia. The suspected pathological area around teeth 23 and 13 showed no visible intraoperative pathological signs. A bone and soft tissue biopsy for histological examination was taken. In the area of tooth 27, a well-marked membrane was revealed, filled with a viscid fluid and fully enclosing the dental crown. The clinical aspect was consistent with a follicular cyst. During the radical cystectomy, tooth 27 was removed due to massive attachment loss. The histopathological biopsy showed a fibroosseous lesion in the area of teeth 13 and 23. The biopsy from region 27 showed an odontogenic connective tissue cyst wall with intramural odontogenic cell islands. On request of the surgeon, samples were sent for further diagnosis to the Bone Tumor Reference Center of the Swiss Society of Pathology"}
{"note": "A 38-year-old male presented with pain in his right thigh. The patient had a past history of treatment for a bone tumor of the right proximal femur. At 20 years of age, the patient had experienced right thigh pain and consulted a doctor at the local hospital. The patient was noted to have a bone tumor of the right femoral bone without distant metastasis and underwent surgical curettage of the tumor. The specimen revealed a malignant small round cell neoplasm with regular nuclear contours, finely dispersed chromatin and scanty cytoplasm without prominent nucleoli (). The patient received one cycle of postoperative chemotherapy that consisted of vincristine and cyclophosphamide and local irradiation with a total dose of 40 Gy. Two years after the initial operation (at 22 years of age), the patient developed severe pain in his right thigh after braking hard while driving. The radiographs taken at the time showed a fracture of the femur where the bone tumor had been located. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using intramedullary nails was performed. One year after the ORIF, the patient stubbed his toe and could not walk due to severe right thigh pain. Radiographs showed an undisplaced femoral re-fracture. He was conservatively treated and subsequent roentgenograms demonstrated bone union. His subsequent postoperative course had been uneventful for 15 years.\nAt 38 years of age, the patient was referred with right thigh pain that had persisted for several months. Radiographs showed a lytic lesion from the trochanteric area to the proximal diaphysis (). Magnetic resonance images showed an intramedullary lesion with an extraskeletal mass () and further metastatic work-up was negative. As local recurrence was suspected, an open biopsy from the intertrochanteric lesion was performed. Microscopic findings revealed a malignant small round cell neoplasm with regular nuclear contours and finely dispersed chromatin without prominent nucleoli (). The microscopic findings were similar to those obtained at first surgery, performed at 20 years of age.

These complaints evolved into a more worrisome pulmonary disease characterized by cough and progressive respiratory distress 2 days prior to the hospitalization. Chest CT scan on admission to an outside hospital showed diffuse bilateral alveolar and interstitial lung infiltrates. A diagnosis of atypical pneumonia and possible myocarditis was made and the patient was given antibiotic treatment and was discharged two weeks later. However, dyspnea persisted and he was admitted to our hospital for further workup. On admission, patient was found to have fever, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and irregular heartbeats with bouts of ventricular fibrillation. Upon hospitalization, additional diagnoses were made including acute renal failure, as well as possible liver disease marked by an elevation of liver function tests. A poorly defined pancreatic mass was noted on the CT scan. Head CT without contrast was performed which showed minimal mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus. There was opacification of several left ethmoid air cells with fluid levels in the left sphenoid and left maxillary sinuses. A nasoenteric tube was in place in nasal cavity. There was no mass lesion, erosion, or bone destruction. These finding were most consistent with mild inflammatory changes ().\nSepsis was suspected and he was given antibiotics without improvement of his clinical condition. His condition rapidly deteriorated with progressive dyspnea and pulmonary infiltrates which by X-ray examination involved all five lobes (). Extensive microbiological studies were performed with no positive bacteriologic, viral, or fungal isolates. The only positive test was a mildly increased DNA load of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in blood with 0.5 copies per microliter detected by a quantitative PCR assay. EBV capsid IgG and nuclear antigen/antibody were positive. Peripheral blood smear showed mild normocytic anemia with moderate thrombocytopenia.

She had previously been in good health with no medical history of note but was just recovering from a severe upper respiratory tract infection, which had caused her to be unwell in bed for several days. Aside from the oral contraceptive pill she took no regular medication and had no family medical history of note.\nInitial investigations with a Doppler ultrasound of her right arm and axilla demonstrated a deep vein thrombosis in the right subclavian vein with extension into the proximal internal jugular vein. A computed tomography scan confirmed the presence of the right axillary vein thrombus and the pulmonary embolus and a large right pleural effusion as shown in Figure . Despite these findings, the patient was hemodynamically stable and after review by the vascular surgery team the decision was made to manage with anticoagulation rather than thrombolysis. The initial imaging also demonstrated enlarged lymph nodes, without the normal fatty hilum, in the mediastinum and right supraclavicular fossa. The imaging of the patient’s abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a mixed echogenicity 13.5cm left adnexal mass situated between the sacrum and the anterior abdominal wall shown in Figure .\nThe tumor markers performed at presentation demonstrated normal values for both hCG and AFP whereas the CA-125 level was moderately elevated at 368U/mL (normal range 0 to 35). The initial management centered on the treatment of the pulmonary embolus with anticoagulation and the insertion of a prophylactic inferior vena cava filter. The differential diagnoses at this stage included: epithelial ovarian cancer, an ovarian germ cell tumor, an ovarian sex cord-stromal tumor or an atypical Meigs syndrome.\nAfter a week of anticoagulation treatment, a laparotomy was performed which demonstrated a large left ovarian mass with ascites but no other abnormal findings.

Other than her diagnosed leukemia, she had no other significant medical history.\nAfter the procedure was explained thoroughly to the patient and her parents, a consent form was completed by her parents, and she was transferred to the CV line room. The patient was very alert and cooperative. Based on the local protocols, all patients requiring CV line placement are transferred to a room dedicated for CV line placement (the intravenous access room), which is located in the operating room. Standard monitoring including an electrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive blood pressure, and pulse-oximetry were initiated. A 20-gauge cannula was inserted into the vein on the dorsum of the patient's left hand.\nThe right internal jugular vein was selected for CV cannulation.\nPropofol was used for sedation, and after adequate sedation, a single-lumen 14-gauge catheter was inserted in the right internal jugular vein using ultrasound sonography under sterile conditions by an experienced anesthesiologist. No problem was encountered during the procedure, and after blood was aspirated, the catheter was fixed at 13 cm. Normal saline infusion was initiated through the CV. Central venous waveforms were not used for catheter position confirmation.\nA chest radiograph was immediately arranged to confirm the catheter position.\nOn chest radiograph, the catheter could be seen looping back and going upward at the junction of the right internal jugular vein and the right subclavian vein (). The team decided to use ultrasonography to verify that the catheter was in the jugular vein and had not punctured the dorsal wall of the vein. During scanning of the right internal jugular vein, only a single lumen of the catheter could be seen until we scanned the bottom third of the jugular vein ().\nWe decided to pull back the catheter under the guidance of ultrasonography until only one lumen could be visualized and then pass a guidewire over the catheter to reposition the catheter."}

The patient presented with fever, tachycardia, and swelling of the right hand (which was the primary site of injection) extending up to the forearm [Figures –]. The patient was haemodynamically stable. An attempt had been made for incision and drainage in the emergency room because it was diagnosed as a injection abscess. An X-ray of the hand revealed a radio-opaque shadow overlying the fourth metacarpal, third and fourth intermetacarpal space extending over the carpus, and the wrist joint up to about 1 cm over the distal end of the radius and ulna dorsal to the skeleton. A diagnosis of extravasation of injected mercury was made. After basic investigations, the patient was shifted to the operation theatre where a thorough debridement was performed under general anaesthesia and a large amount of mercury was removed physically from the dorsum of the hand. Some of the mercury could only be removed along with excision of the surrounding soft tissue; the removal of mercury was confirmed by radiography. The wound was left open so that any mercury left behind could find a passage to come out. On the following day, the patient went home against medical advice but came back on the 7th of March with a history of another subcutaneous injection of elemental mercury over the precordium. Once again, an attempt had been made to drain an abscess in another hospital. The patient refused any further surgical procedures although the radiograph showed the deposition of mercury in the subcutaneous plane in the chest wall. The patient turned up in October 2005, with a swelling over the precordium with surrounding inflammation []. This time, he was willing for surgery and the mercury was removed along with surrounding tissue en masse and the wound healed uneventfully.\nOn both occasions, the patient was not willing to be subjected to"}

As per our hospital protocol we use low molecular weight heparin for 6 weeks for thromboprophylaxis in total hip replacement patients.\nAfter 3 months of surgery, patient came back with the complaint of pain in the left inguinal region and development of ecchymosis over the left inguinal region. Patient was readmitted to the hospital for observation and further investigation. Next morning patient started complaining of weakness of left lower limb and numbness over medial aspect of thigh and knee. On physical examination, the patient was found to have grade 3/5 motor function of the quadriceps muscle, as well as decreased light touch and pinprick sensation over the femoral nerve distribution area. Patient did not have any spine tenderness.\nBlood investigations showed mild anemia with haemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL.

A CT chest and upper abdomen demonstrated consolidation of the right lung base and he was treated for his pneumonia and atrial fibrillation. Shortly after admission he developed abdominal pain, diarrhoea and a low-grade pyrexia. His CT scan was reviewed and it was noted that there was a small amount of intra-abdominal fluid with several retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The right kidney had an atypical area of calcification within its upper pole and he was subsequently referred to the urologists for further evaluation (). As his condition failed to improve he underwent a further CT scan that demonstrated a large right psoas abscess (). This was drained under CT guidance and he was eventually discharged with a urology outpatient follow up as it was thought his renal problem was the cause of the abscess. Upon review the patient was symptomatically better, a diagnosis of an old calcified cyst in the right kidney was made and he was discharged to his GP.\nEight months later, after a permanent pacemaker had been fitted, an interval USS showed no residual psoas abscess. However, one month subsequently he was admitted under the general surgeons with a 3-week history of mild back pain, diarrhoea and rigors. He also had a discharging abscess in his right lumbar region which contained gas bubbles. A CT scan revealed sigmoid diverticulosis () with a recurrence of the extensive right-sided retroperitoneal abscess and a tract connecting it to the sigmoid colon ().\nAs an interim measure whilst being optimised for surgery, the abscess was drained with a 14F pigtail drain.

The patient had no complications, no genetic diseases, and had conceived spontaneously. She had undergone prenatal management and care at the hospital near her residence. Ultrasonographic examinations performed during the 25th week of gestation by the referring hospital demonstrated a fetal cardiac tumor. Ultrasonographic examinations performed at the first visit revealed a single, homogeneous tumor 14 mm in diameter in the intracardic space (). The tumor was believed to emerge from the ventricular septum and to occupy the left ventricle. A significant pericardial effusion was noted. The ventricular and atrial rates were 140 beats per minute and no atrioventricular block was observed. Other cardiac abnormalities were not detected, and the velocity of blood flow in the aorta and pulmonary arteries was within the normal range. The fetus was diagnosed with an intracardic tumor, possibly cardiac rhabdomyoma. Pedigree analyses revealed no family history of tuberous sclerosis.\nThe patient was managed in the outpatient clinic at our hospital. Serial ultrasonographic examinations were performed and fetal cardiac function was investigated. The size of the fetal cardiac tumor gradually increased (), although the fetal cardiac function was revealed to be within the normal range. The patient was hospitalized with the onset of spontaneous labor pain in the 39th week of gestation, and a female infant weighing 2716 g was delivered with Apgar scores of nine and ten at one and five minutes after delivery, respectively.

The patient had a history of thyroid follicular adenocarcinoma which was treated surgically with total thyroidectomy and postoperative iodine treatment 25 years prior to presentation. At 12 years post thyroidectomy, she was diagnosed with a calcaneal mass of the same pathology and diagnosed with delayed distant thyroid carcinoma metastasis to the calcaneus. 10 years after calcaneal mass excision, the patient was diagnosed with a proximal tibial mass that turned out to be also delayed metastasis of the same pathology.\nAt the first presentation 15 years ago, she initially presented complaining of mild edema of the left ankle with intermittent pain upon daily activity. Physical exam showed full range of motion of the ankle joint with intact motor power and intact neurovascular status. There were no cutaneous lesions.\nPlain radiographs of the left ankle showed a 3-centimeter oval lytic lesion in the anterior aspect of the calcaneum ().\nAn MRI of the left ankle showed a 3.2 cm well-defined benign-looking lytic lesion of the calcaneal neck reaching the cortex which appeared to be mildly irregular with mild degenerative disease of the posterior subtalar joint consistent with an intraosseous ganglion cyst of the calcaneus ().\nMedical treatment with NSAIDs and paracetamol was initiated, along with partial weight bearing and relative rest with no improvement at follow-up at 4 weeks. Surgical intervention was decided due to the persistent pain. The cyst was resected with a margin of surrounding fibro-osseous tissue and the bone grafted. Histopathological evaluation revealed a metastatic carcinoma of the thyroid gland. Immunostaining showed that the cells expressed cytokeratin, cytokeratin 7, and thyroglobulin, all of which confirm the diagnosis ().\nFor further confirmation, the recently excised cyst slides were compared to the pathology slides of the thyroid excision undertaken 12 years prior to the calcaneal presentation and were found out to be of the same pathology ().\nThe patient had"}

Earlier that evening, the patient had been playing basketball at a local church when he jumped for a rebound and experienced severe pain in the left hip and thigh upon landing. He was unable to bear weight. At that time, he was taken to a local emergency department where he underwent immediate evaluation. Following the initial evaluation and review of radiographs, it was determined that the patient had sustained a subtrochanteric periprosthetic femur fracture. At that time, he was transferred to our facility for definitive management.\nAfter further investigation and questioning upon arrival at our facility, the patient reported a 5-6 month history of increasing left thigh pain prior to this injury. He had never received any medical care for the new onset thigh pain and attributed it to overuse. New radiographs obtained at our facility demonstrated a transverse periprosthetic femur fracture at the distal aspect of the previously placed dynamic hip screw. Nine years prior at the age of 11, the patient had been involved in a motor vehicle accident sustaining a subtrochanteric femur fracture which was addressed with reduction and placement of a dynamic hip screw (DHS). The surgery was noted to be performed flawlessly with no complications noted, but little is known about the details of the postoperative course as it was done at an outside facility.\nDespite discussions with the index surgeon to eventually remove the hardware, his case was never scheduled and the hardware was retained into skeletal maturity. Close inspection of imaging at the time of repeat injury showed evidence of a potential stress riser at the distal DHS/bone junction, with a significant amount of bony overgrowth of the DHS ().

She reports no past medical history, and social history is notable for tobacco use. The patient stated that she first noticed a small, yellow, and fleshy bump on her right nipple approximately two years prior. She became concerned due to its rapid growth in the last year. Four months prior, she visited her primary care provider who performed a shave biopsy of the lesion. Initial pathology results suggested squamous cell carcinoma, but this was thought to be discordant with the clinical picture. At consultation, she reported that her right breast had also started feeling hot and tender for two weeks duration. On examination, her right breast was erythematous and rigid with a 2.2 cm lesion consuming the right nipple. Her nipple also drained yellow pus. The patient was placed on a course of antibiotics due to concerns for an abscess.\nAn MRI was ordered to investigate possible underlying breast malignancy. Results of the MRI showed no solid mass underlying the nipple. A wedge biopsy of the nipple was performed to confirm the initial shave biopsy pathology (). Pathology showed verrucous histologic features with chronic inflammation and underlying abscess with concerns for a possible cutaneous malignancy. Specifically, there was marked papillomatosis with hypergranulomatosis between the papillae as well as a lack of granules at the papillary surfaces. Immunohistochemical testing was also positive for HPV L1 capsid protein. Because the initial shave biopsy showed SCC with positive margins, this clinical picture suggested that an inadequate sample was taken during the wedge biopsy. After consultation of literature, excision with wide margins was determined to be appropriate for removal of the lesion.\nThe patient underwent a wide excision of the right nipple-areola complex for removal of the growth. A 6.2 cm x 3.2 cm skin ellipse was excised encompassing the 2.2 cm nipple lesion. On final histologic examination, the lesion was found to be a large tumor with ver"}

When she was told the images of her children and the people in front belonged to each other, she insisted that ‘those people’ did not carry the emotions and the mannerisms that were so familiar to her. She vehemently denied that the people in her front were her own children rather became quite defensive and said that “I am sure that they are not my children at all”.

The patient had been resuscitated initially by infusion of crystalloids at the emergency department and intra-abdominal complications had been ruled out by physical exam and ultrasound studies.\nAt the beginning of emergent operation due to bilateral epidural hematoma, the patient was tachycardic with acceptable blood pressure (110/65 mmHg). Premedication with 2 Mcg/Kg of fentanyl was implemented. Induction of anesthesia was carried out by sevoflurane via an endotracheal tube previously fixed at the emergency department and appropriate dose of cisatracurium was used for muscle relaxation.\nAfter an hour of cranial decompressive surgery, both large intravenous lines became malfunctioning. For this reason, preparation of another large bore peripheral intravenous line was planned yet multiple trials of our expert colleagues failed and the medical team was forced to plan for establishment of a centrally inserted intravenous catheter. Surgical conditions and patient dressing forced the selection of the right femoral vein for this purpose. The patient had become hemodynamically unstable at that time and because of that, femoral artery pulsation wasn’t palpable in the anatomically expected site. Next, insertion of an introducer catheter next to the weak pulsation of femoral artery and a little below the inguinal ligament was decided. After appropriate preparation, central vein catheterization was performed uneventfully by a single trial and appropriateness of placement was confirmed by aspiration of all three lumens of the catheter and visualization of retrograde flow of liquid due to gravity and pressure difference laws. The catheter was then fixed to the skin and the entire area was dressed appropriately.\nDuring the surgery, infusion of 2 units of packed RBCs and 2 liters of crystalloid were done by the means of a central line. Infusion of norepinephrine was considered too because of diminished blood pressure right before thinking about central catheterization following a large amount of blood lost in the surgical field.\nAt the end of surgery, the"}

He was referred to the hospital because of a huge abdominal mass on his lower left side that had been there for 7 years. It was associated with discomfort and heaviness, progressively increased in size, yielded no pain, no other swelling, no history of trauma or surgeries, and no constitutional symptoms. Therefore, otherwise, the patient was healthy.\nThe patient's BMI was 29.53. The mass measured about 15 × 13 cm in the left lower abdomen (). There were no signs of infection or skin abnormalities; the mass was soft and mobile, tethered to the skin, and was not pulsatile or tender. There were no abdominal hernias.\nBlood work was within normal limits. An MRI abdomen with contrast was taken and showed subcutaneous fat tissue with no worrisome underlying mass or abdominal enhancement to suggest liposarcoma. There was no definitive evidence of an abdominal wall hernia. The visualized portion of the pelvic organs and bones appeared to be grossly normal. The patient was admitted to the surgical ward for surgical excision of the mass and provided consent for the surgery.\nThe procedure was carried out under general anesthesia. The patient was placed in a supine position on the operating table, and the abdomen was prepared and draped in the standard sterile manner.

The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan, and bronchoscopy, and was found to have a 9 mm fatty endobronchial lesion in the bronchus intermedius above the middle lobe with 2 cm extraluminal fatty lesion into the right hilum. An endobronchial ultrasound with biopsy of the mass was performed, which showed benign bronchial epithelial cells. Since endobronchial resection of the mass would lead to a large defect in the right bronchus intermedius, the decision was made to perform robotic-assisted resection of the lesion (Video ).\nWe used the Da Vinci Xi robot to perform resection of the endobronchial lesion and hilar mass with right lower lobe superior segmentectomy to remove the lesion. The patient had a “five on a dice” port placement for the operation [, ]. First, we performed the right lower lobe superior segmentectomy to obtain adequate exposure of the hilar mass. We mobilized the superior segmental branch of pulmonary artery and superior segmental branch of the right lower lobe going to the inferior pulmonary vein and divided them with the vascular robot stapler. We divided the superior segmental branch of right lower lobe bronchus with the robot blue load stapler. We used indocyanine green angiography to define the borders of the superior segment of the right lower lobe, which was divided using the robot blue load stapler. This provided access to the hilar fatty tumor, which allowed for removal of the hilar mass and subsequent resection of endobronchial lesion with scissors. The frozen section on both lesions was negative for malignancy. We confirmed complete resection with intraoperative bronchoscopy that also showed a large opening in the airway.\nIn order to reconstruct the airway, we placed two 3-0 vicryl stay sutures at the proximal and distal ends of the airway and placed the suture through the posterior ports to pull the airway posteriorly away from the"}

The patient was diagnosed at birth with a mitral valve defect which was surgically repaired at age 2. However, at the age of 12, her native mitral valve was replaced with a St. Jude Master Series 27 mm mitral valve prosthesis. After replacement with mechanical mitral valve, she was prescribed oral warfarin therapy for anticoagulation. Her anticoagulation was managed by her cardiologist at an outside facility with a target INR of 2.5 to 3.5. The patient admitted to being compliant with her warfarin therapy. The patient only noted one prior ischemic event, a TIA at 12 years old, which was attributed to a missed medication dose. She said her mother forgot to give her the medication prior to the TIA. Her INRs were checked weekly although the patient did not have any lab work to present at the time of presentation. Approximately seven months prior to presentation, the patient became pregnant for her first time. She was switched from warfarin to Lovenox therapy to avoid teratogenic effects of warfarin to the fetus. Lovenox dosage was 60 mg (1 mg per kg dosing) administered twice daily, with antifactor Xa monitored by her cardiologist. The patient admitted to strict compliance to this anticoagulation regimen without any missed dosages. During her 8th week of pregnancy, the patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of difficulty speaking and bilateral facial/upper extremity weakness. She was diagnosed with bilateral MCA infarcts and not deemed a candidate for intervention due to her pregnancy. During her admission for the stroke, the patient suffered a missed abortion. She was eventually discharged to a rehabilitation center for poststroke care and regained full motor and speech function. Approximately 3 months after her"}

He was given multiple doses of naloxone in the field without any improvement in mental status. On presentation in the emergency department (ED), the patient was found unresponsive to questions and unable to follow commands but withdrawing to painful stimuli, with a Glasgow Coma Score of 8, and tachypneic. Vital signs were significant for a respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 90% on 6 liters nasal cannula. Physical exam appreciated no tracheal deviation and no jugular venous distention but exhibited an uneven rise and fall of his chest on the right side compared to the left. On cardiopulmonary auscultation, absent breath sounds of the right lung fields were noted with normal cardiac heart sounds. The patient was emergently intubated for airway protection in the ED, and further evaluation was initiated. Immediate imaging with portable chest X-ray was obtained which showed extensive lucency in the right hemithorax suggestive of large pneumothorax or an air-filled cyst (). A CT scan of the chest was performed which suggested extensive pneumothorax of the right lung without a mediastinal shift ().\nFor this reason, an emergent 24 French chest tube was placed in the right 6th intercostal space but failed to expand the lung. In response, the chest tube was then exchanged for a 32 French tube under the assumption that a larger size may be required, but it too failed to expand the lung. There was no air drainage from either tube placed suggesting lack of a pneumothorax. He was stabilized and admitted to the intensive care unit for further management. A few hours after admission, he underwent bronchoscopy with a right chest VATS which revealed a giant bulla encasing the entire right pleural cavity with its origin in the right upper lobe beginning at the apex. The bulla was extracted, and pleurodesis was performed by mechanical and chemical means. After the procedure, the patient's respiratory"}

He presented a history of a sudden onset of severe headache three weeks prior to his visit to our institution. Except the surgical history of cholecystectomy in 2014, he had neither a history of epilepsy nor medical diseases. He was an alert patient without neurologic deficit on his first arrival. The initial brain computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a 3.5 × 3.2 cm sized oval shape mass filled with a thrombus. A midline shift to the left of 3 mm and a slightly decreased size of right lateral ventricle were observed. The brain CT scan with contrast showed a mass-like lesion with a heterogeneous enhancement. It was identified to be a large tortuous vessel connected to an aneurysmal sac arising from the inferior trunk of right middle cerebral artery (MCA) according to the brain CT angiography (). The brain MRI revealed a mass of heterogenic signal intensity suggesting different stages of thrombus formation within the aneurysmal sac (). The patient consequently underwent a distracted subtraction angiography (DSA). We observed a contrast pooling in the inferior trunk of right MCA and a dilated outflow, which was drained to the distal MCA branches ().\nUpon his hospital admission, he had no further seizure events, but, his symptoms of headache and dizziness remained the same consistently. Subsequently, a BOT was carried out to assess the patency of collateral cerebral circulation. After the proximal occlusion of the aneurysm by Sceptor C balloon (Microvention, Tustin CA, USA), the following parameters were intensively monitored for half an hour: the patient's somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP); cognitive and language function; and motor and sensory changes. The patient did not present any neurologic symptoms during the test ().\nBased on the BOT results, an endovascular embolization was planned. 100 mg of aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel were given to the patient for seven days"}
{"note": "A 42 year old female presented with a progressively enlarging painless swelling in the anterior part of the neck since 1 year. The only complaint was that of disfigurement. There was no other significant history. On examination, a single swelling was present in anterior neck, 13 × 8 cm in size, irregular in shape, extending vertically from thyroid cartilage above to supra sternal notch below and between two sternomastoid muscles. It was firm in consistency, moved freely with deglutition and had ill defined lower margin. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Examination of respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous systems and abdomen were normal. Thyroid function test was within normal range and FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) of the thyroid swelling revealed papillary carcinoma. Ultrasound of the neck documented a single mass in anterior neck, 12 × 8 cms in size with complex cystic and solid components without any associated cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient was planned for total thyroidectomy. Intra operative findings included slightly enlarged left lobe of thyroid (4 × 3 × 3 cm) with normal sized right lobe (3 × 3 × 2 cm). Another swelling (thymus) about 8 × 4 × 3 cm in size was found incidentally, adjacent to but separate from the thyroid at its lower margin and extending upto suprasternal notch. The thyroid and the thymus were only connected by a fibrous band (figure ). Total thyroidectomy with thymectomy was performed. Post operative period was uneventful. The histopathological examination of the thyroid specimen revealed papillary carcinoma (figures and ) and the sections from attached mass (thymus) revealed multiple cysts with its tissue replaced by metastatic papillary carcinoma of thyroid (figures and ). Both tumors were reactive to thyroglobulin, keratin and CD3 confirming papillary carcinoma of thyroid with metastasis to ectopic cervical thymus.

Due to his lack of health-care insurance and ineligibility for funding to receive outpatient dialysis, he presented several times to the ED for intermittent dialysis where he was admitted and dialyzed if his symptoms met criteria for emergent dialysis. He survived this way for many years. On this presentation for emergent dialysis, he suffered a cardiac event requiring intubation for a cardiac cath. It was during extubation that the clinician noted marked the prominence of the palate and mucosal ulceration. Once stable from the procedure, further history from the patient was elicited. The patient noted that the bulky hard mass on his palate had been present for several years and grew slowly overtime. He also noted progressive swelling and disfigurement of his face and noticed a hard mass along his mandible which had also grown overtime. The mass was not associated with pain and because he did not have insurance, he did not go to the doctor for further evaluation. He did not know what was causing the changes in his face. Oral maxillary surgery was consulted and they requested a computed tomography (CT) maxillary face [] to be performed for further evaluation. It revealed severe enlargement of the maxilla and mandible with a coarse, marbled appearance of the bony matrix seen as alternating wavy bands of lucency and sclerosis. The bony expansion was most prominent at the maxilla and mandible with a bulky expanded hard palate accounting for the mass seen during extubation. These abnormal bony changes were also seen in other bones of the face, though less prominent, and at the skull base.\nOn review of the patient’s chart and its documentation during multiple prior admissions for emergent dialysis, additional imaging and laboratory tests were analyzed. The patient had a long history of significantly elevated creatinine levels up to 17.5 mg/dL (normal 67–1.17 mg/dL), low glomerular filtration"}

It was learned that the patient had slipped and fallen down on his back about 20 days before but had no complaints afterward, and 10 days after the minor trauma, he suddenly started to have very severe pain in the neck root. His pain had gradually grown progressively and begun to spread to the right arm. Radiological findings showed compression on the spinal canal and deterioration of the cervical lordosis due to height loss in the C6 vertebra corpus [–].\nIn the present case, it was thought that the pathological compression fracture (collapse) in C6 corpus may be secondary to infection or due to metastasis. In the examination for a primary etiologic cause, a large mass with a diameter of 10 cm was found in the left kidney in abdominal computed tomography (CT) images. Due to his severe pain, a cervical sixth vertebrae corpectomy was performed through the anterior without delay. A 7–8 cm bone autograft was taken from the middle section of his own right leg fibula to put it in the gap created after the corpectomy. The top and bottom ends of the fibula graft were smoothened with a high-speed drill. The size of the graft was tried to be kept high, especially to ensure physiological lordosis. During the surgery, the fibula was implanted at the distance cleared by applying traction on the patient's head. After ensuring that the lordosis was obtained, and the graft was in the right place, the fibula was supported using an anterior plaque to reduce the likelihood of the fibula to come loose. Postoperative cervical vertebra was controlled by lateral cervical X-ray and CT [ and ].\nPostoperative pain occurring on the leg of the case did not prevent mobilization on the 1st day.

At 29 weeks of gestation, blindly ended vessels originating from the heart or transposition of the great arteries was first noticed. However, no comments were made regarding any abnormal findings of the fetal lung on a fetal ultrasonography. In addition, the medical and obstetric histories were unremarkable.\nAn ultrasound examination performed on the day of the first visit at our institute demonstrated an elevated diaphragm, raising the suspicion of associated lung abnormalities (). The thoracic cavities, especially on the right, were reduced in size. The left thoracic cavity was largely occupied by the heart with a severely left-deviated axis, resulting from the remarkable displacement of the diaphragm cephalad. However, it was not evident whether any lung tissue was present, or whether there were any lung abnormalities or pulmonary veins connecting to the left atrium as well as the right and left branches of the main pulmonary artery. As a result, no specific structural abnormalities of the heart were identified.\nFor further evaluation of the lung abnormalities, a fetal MRI study was performed. Similar to the results of the ultrasound examinations, a significantly decreased thoracic volume associated with a bilateral elevation of the diaphragm was identified, thus resulting in an upward migration of the heart and rotation of the cardiac axis. Moreover, no definite lung was identified and the trachea ended blindly near the level of the cricoid cartilage without bronchial branching (). Together, these findings strongly supported the diagnosis of BPA.\nA male fetus weighing 2,530 g was delivered vaginally at 39 + 2 weeks of gestation after the induction of labor and in the presence of neonatologists. The Apgar scores at 1, 5, and 10 minutes after birth were 2, 2, and 2, respectively.

Chest examination revealed reduced breath sounds at the left base.\nChest radiography and CT examination ((a),(b),(c)) revealed a 10 cm ovoid lesion in the left lower lobe adjacent to the pleura. The penetration suggested it was a fluid filled structure. A similar looking lesion was also noted in the left adrenal (). He underwent a fibre-optic bronchoscopy. Some brown adherent material was seen at the orifice of the posterior and lateral segment of the left lower lobe. Washings and biopsies were taken.

The change was red, hard and painful to touch, attached to the skin. It was surgically removed. Primary histopathological finding was follicular keratosis. Recurrent tumor appeared in surgical incision area only seven days after the operation, as well as the onset of extreme swelling of the upper lip tumorous tissue (size < 2 cm). The patient was sent to a tertiary hospital. After the hospital admission, the fungal or bacterial infection of the lesion was excluded. Soft, reddish nodular tumor with the size of 5 × 2 cm with sebaceous cysts and telangiectasias was clinically observed ( and ). Swollen lymph nodes (< 13 mm diameter) were detected on both sides of the neck and in the right axillary fossa there was one swollen lymph node around 10 mm in size. All biochemical and serological blood tests were within normal reference ranges. Well differentiated, keratinized, squamous cell carcinoma of the upper lip was diagnosed after the histopathological audit. Tumorous tissue infiltrated all papillary and reticular dermis, muscle fibers and perineural spaces and is visible on the lower resection line ( and ). With the second surgical intervention the upper lip skin cancer was removed and the defect reconstructed. Final postoperative result was shown in the . In the time of the second surgical intervention, lymph nodes on both sides of the neck could not be identified either on palpation or by ultrasound examination. Earlier detected lymph node, with almost normal ultrasound characteristics, could not be seen or palpated, thus there was no need for a lymph node biopsy. Postoperative findings of lymph nodes showed only transient reactive lymphadenopathy.

The patient had a history of thyroid follicular adenocarcinoma which was treated surgically with total thyroidectomy and postoperative iodine treatment 25 years prior to presentation. At 12 years post thyroidectomy, she was diagnosed with a calcaneal mass of the same pathology and diagnosed with delayed distant thyroid carcinoma metastasis to the calcaneus. 10 years after calcaneal mass excision, the patient was diagnosed with a proximal tibial mass that turned out to be also delayed metastasis of the same pathology.\nAt the first presentation 15 years ago, she initially presented complaining of mild edema of the left ankle with intermittent pain upon daily activity. Physical exam showed full range of motion of the ankle joint with intact motor power and intact neurovascular status. There were no cutaneous lesions.\nPlain radiographs of the left ankle showed a 3-centimeter oval lytic lesion in the anterior aspect of the calcaneum ().\nAn MRI of the left ankle showed a 3.2 cm well-defined benign-looking lytic lesion of the calcaneal neck reaching the cortex which appeared to be mildly irregular with mild degenerative disease of the posterior subtalar joint consistent with an intraosseous ganglion cyst of the calcaneus ().\nMedical treatment with NSAIDs and paracetamol was initiated, along with partial weight bearing and relative rest with no improvement at follow-up at 4 weeks. Surgical intervention was decided due to the persistent pain. The cyst was resected with a margin of surrounding fibro-osseous tissue and the bone grafted. Histopathological evaluation revealed a metastatic carcinoma of the thyroid gland. Immunostaining showed that the cells expressed cytokeratin, cytokeratin 7, and thyroglobulin, all of which confirm the diagnosis ().\nFor further confirmation, the recently excised cyst slides were compared to the pathology slides of the thyroid excision undertaken 12 years prior to the calcaneal presentation and were found out to be of the same pathology ().\nThe patient had"}

On clinical examination there was a painless solid mass 6–7 cm in length, little sensitive to pressure, firmly attached to deeper tissues. Percussion over the mass produced a Tinel’s like sensation along the median nerve. The patient experienced mild numbness in the distribution of the median nerve in the palm but no motor weakness or muscle atrophy was detected. No cutaneous pigmented lesions were found. The patient reported he first palpated a nodule 10 years ago that grew up very slowly to the current size. No history of significant trauma was recalled.\nAn MRI examination revealed a 6 cm long, well circumscribed mass in close proximity to the neurovascular bundle of the arm. The lesion had a relatively homogenous low signal, slightly lower to the muscle, on T1 images. On T1 fat suppressed images, increased gadolinium enhancement was noticed at the periphery of the mass with a nonenhancing low signal central area (Fig. a). No peri-tumoral edema was present and a line of fat surrounded the tumor. Based on the long history of the patient, and the clinical and MRI features, the diagnosis of a nerve sheath tumor arising from the median nerve was supported and the patient was scheduled for excisional biopsy. A longitudinal incision centered over the tumor bulk was performed. The tumor had an eccentric position and was firmly attached to the median nerve, (Fig. b). An incisional biopsy was performed and tissue sample was taken from the proximal pole of the mass (where more viable tissue was seen on MRI). The sample was considered to be representative of the entire pathology macroscopically and was sent for frozen section. Intra-operative biopsy examination revealed nuclear atypia.

He was a smoker and occasional drinker but did not have allergic and vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. There was no history of medication use.\nTwo weeks earlier, he had a motorcycle accident and crashed into a truck with the right leg as the focus of impact. He was immediately brought to the hospital, where he was taken plain X-Ray on the right leg with suspicion of open fracture of the right lower limb. Clinically, the patient was alert and complained that he had intense pain and unable to move the right leg. The doctor explained the urgent need for operation as there was an open fracture observed, but the patient decided to discharge against medical advice and sought home treatment with a TBS. During the treatment, the leg was directly manipulated by holding the patient down, while the TBS performed the manipulation without using analgesics.

An endobronchial ultrasound with biopsy of the mass was performed, which showed benign bronchial epithelial cells. Since endobronchial resection of the mass would lead to a large defect in the right bronchus intermedius, the decision was made to perform robotic-assisted resection of the lesion (Video ).\nWe used the Da Vinci Xi robot to perform resection of the endobronchial lesion and hilar mass with right lower lobe superior segmentectomy to remove the lesion.

She reports no past medical history, and social history is notable for tobacco use. The patient stated that she first noticed a small, yellow, and fleshy bump on her right nipple approximately two years prior. She became concerned due to its rapid growth in the last year. Four months prior, she visited her primary care provider who performed a shave biopsy of the lesion. Initial pathology results suggested squamous cell carcinoma, but this was thought to be discordant with the clinical picture. At consultation, she reported that her right breast had also started feeling hot and tender for two weeks duration. On examination, her right breast was erythematous and rigid with a 2.2 cm lesion consuming the right nipple. Her nipple also drained yellow pus. The patient was placed on a course of antibiotics due to concerns for an abscess.\nAn MRI was ordered to investigate possible underlying breast malignancy. Results of the MRI showed no solid mass underlying the nipple. A wedge biopsy of the nipple was performed to confirm the initial shave biopsy pathology (). Pathology showed verrucous histologic features with chronic inflammation and underlying abscess with concerns for a possible cutaneous malignancy. Specifically, there was marked papillomatosis with hypergranulomatosis between the papillae as well as a lack of granules at the papillary surfaces. Immunohistochemical testing was also positive for HPV L1 capsid protein. Because the initial shave biopsy showed SCC with positive margins, this clinical picture suggested that an inadequate sample was taken during the wedge biopsy. After consultation of literature, excision with wide margins was determined to be appropriate for removal of the lesion.\nThe patient underwent a wide excision of the right nipple-areola complex for removal of the growth.

She returned to the emergency department the following day with headache and malaise and systolic blood pressure above 200 mmHg for which she was treated and discharged.\nShe returned to the emergency department again 5 days later, this time with complaints of word finding difficulty, blurred vision, and lower extremity tingling. Her blood pressure on presentation was 216/81 mmHg. She was admitted, and workup demonstrated no acute intracranial process or carotid stenosis. Echocardiography revealed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with a preserved ejection fraction. Her blood pressure continued to be refractory to medical therapy despite five antihypertensive agents and eventual initiation of an esmolol infusion. A renal artery ultrasound identified renal artery stenosis with flow at the arterial origin measuring 350 cm/s on the right and 208 cm/s on the left (); flow velocity in the supraceliac aorta was also noted to be elevated. She had no history of kidney disease and no elevation of her creatinine. Vascular surgery was consulted and a history of lower extremity claudication was elicited.

Significant past history included multiple episodes of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Coronary angiography demonstrated a single coronary artery arising from left coronary sinus (fig ) which divided into a normal sized left anterior descending artery (LAD) and a circumflex (Cx) artery. LAD had a 99% stenotic lesion beyond the first septal and was a good sized vessel going just beyond the left ventricular apex (Fig ). From its proximal segment, beyond the origin of first diagonal and prior to the origin of first septal artery, arose 3 right ventricular branches, the largest of which crossed the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), 2 centimetres below the pulmonary valve, to gain the anterior right atrioventricular groove (Fig , ), descended in the groove to anastomose with the distal right coronary artery (Fig ), which arose as a continuity of the circumflex artery (Fig ), as described below. The second right ventricular branch crossed the RVOT below the first but petered out well before it could gain the anterior right AV groove. The third branch supplied the right ventricle and followed a course close to the LAD (fig ). The diagonal artery was a large bifurcating artery with significant proximal stenosis. The circumflex artery had severe stenosis proximally after which it gave a large obtuse marginal branch and then the PDA in the posterior interventricular groove and thereafter continued in the AV groove as the right coronary artery (Fig ). This right coronary artery then gave off a ventricular branch to the inferior surface of the right ventricle and thereafter anastomosed with the proximal RCA arising anomalously from the LAD as described above (Fig ).

On intraoral examination, high arched palate was observed with uncoordinated mandibular movements as a consequence of the patient was suffering from a neurological disorder []. It was also found that the patient had restricted vertical mouth opening of 15–20 mm. These signs were foreseen to be problematic while making impressions in a conventional manner. The high arched palate present in the patient further hampered the dentist's requirement of recording an ideal impression. The customized balloon impression tray appears to have been made in an attempt to optimize dental impression under the conditions presented by the patient.\nThe key for a successful prosthesis is an accurate impression, as the prosthesis that is fabricated in the laboratory is only as accurate as the impression made.\nThe stock tray was modified by reducing the height of the flanges and removal of the palatal part of the tray. The trimmed tray devoid of the palatal extension was attached with a flat acrylic palatal plate with auto-polymerizing resin. The flat palatal part thereby enabled the attachment of a latex balloon over it The latex balloon selected for attachment was tube-shaped so as to ensure proper adaptation to the palate when inflated and not expand horizontally to a considerable extent.

{"note": "A 29-year-old Middle Eastern male bodybuilder with a history of prior repeated synthol injections presented at our clinic with ongoing pain and deformity in both upper arms. At the age of 25, our patient had 3mL synthol repeatedly injected by an unlicensed friend into both biceps brachii muscles. Injections were administered four times per week for a total period of four weeks. The total number of injections was 16 injections per biceps muscle. Our patient experienced pain and pressure in the injected muscle directly after each injection. The pain was rated initially as four using a visual analogue scale retrospectively. Despite this, a training session was carried out by our patient after each injection. His perception of pain gradually increased to six out of ten, and after two years our patient ceased training due to the severe pain (rated seven out of ten). Initially, our patient had been able to withstand the pain but, after two years of drug administration, the pain was increasing and not tolerable due to its constant and persistent nature.\nUpon physical examination, our patient was observed to have rubbery firm hypertrophic and dysmorphic biceps in both arms (Figure ) with a free range of motion. He complained of a constant painful pressure within his right muscle more than his left one, and muscle deformity. He had several tender points all over his biceps muscle. A diagnosis was made through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which revealed a swollen right biceps muscle and cystic lesions scattered throughout the muscle tissue with a hyperintense signal. MRI indicated these lesions to be oil deposits between muscle fibers, termed oleomas (Figure ). It was concluded that his muscle underwent fibrotic changes in its appearance. In addition, contrast enhancement was inhomogeneous, indicating the presence of inflammation (Figure ).\nFor ongoing pain and with no therapeutic alternatives, an open surgical excision of the anterior third of his biceps was carried out through an anterior bicipital approach. Intraoperative findings showed no common muscle tissue left but massive fibrotic"}
{"note": "A 78-year-old Caucasian gentleman presented with a painful 2 cm irregular swelling in the nail bed of the distal phalanx of the right middle finger, with brown discolouration of the nail bed. The swelling in the digit had been present for ∼30 years, which had begun following a fracture of the terminal phalanx and had gradually increased in size over the preceding 6 months. There was no axillary or cervical lymphadenopathy and the patient was fit and well.\nClinically a differential diagnosis of an aggressive adenocarcinoma was suspected, but this was not supported by multiple radiological investigations. CT and MRI of the lesion showed a vascular destructive lesion that was causing severe erosion of the distal interphalangeal bone (Figs and , respectively). A plain chest radiograph at that time showed no pulmonary metastasis.\nAs the radiological investigations had shown that the distal phalanx was not viable and a lack of proximal invasion, it was felt appropriate to perform an amputation at the level of middle to distal third of the middle phalanx. Such an amputation was aimed at being curative, in addition to providing a definite diagnosis, maintaining function and allowing for primary closure.\nThe patient underwent an amputation of the middle phalanx of the right middle finger. Histopathology of the specimen showed a high mitotic grade lesion with a small focus of lymphovascular invasion, diagnostic of ADPA (Fig. ). The tumour was 0.7 mm from the nearest resection margin. The high rates of recurrence and metastasis were explained to the patient, who declined further surgical treatment.\nSeventeen months following initial presentation, the patient developed a mass in the right axilla. In addition, subsequent plain chest radiograph (Fig. ) and CT of the thorax showed multiple pulmonary metastasis. An axillary clearance was performed and one of the ten nodes confirmed metastatic disease. Shortly after this, the patient suffered an intracranial haemorrhage into the right internal capsule. Over the last 2 years the patient has remained only mildly short of breath due to his pulmonary metastasis"}

She returned to the emergency department the following day with headache and malaise and systolic blood pressure above 200 mmHg for which she was treated and discharged.\nShe returned to the emergency department again 5 days later, this time with complaints of word finding difficulty, blurred vision, and lower extremity tingling. Her blood pressure on presentation was 216/81 mmHg. She was admitted, and workup demonstrated no acute intracranial process or carotid stenosis. Echocardiography revealed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with a preserved ejection fraction. Her blood pressure continued to be refractory to medical therapy despite five antihypertensive agents and eventual initiation of an esmolol infusion. A renal artery ultrasound identified renal artery stenosis with flow at the arterial origin measuring 350 cm/s on the right and 208 cm/s on the left (); flow velocity in the supraceliac aorta was also noted to be elevated.

{"note": "The patient was a 69-year-old woman whose abnormality was initially identified by chest radiography at a local hospital in 2008. At that time, transthoracic echocardiography revealed a calcified and immobile mass on the posterior mitral valve leaflet. She was referred to our hospital for evaluation of the mass. Her past history was significant with pulmonary tuberculosis at the age of 6 years and systemic hypertension. However, there was no history of infectious endocarditis or chest trauma. Any thrombus formation due to a hypercoagulable state was not recognized. Differential diagnoses included calcified cardiac fibroelastoma and myxoma. We offered her a surgical treatment option because of the potential risk of a thromboembolic event. However, she refused the surgical intervention. She was managed on an outpatient basis and periodically underwent transthoracic echocardiographic evaluations every 6 months.\nThe patient claimed to have chest discomfort in March 2011 and was admitted to our hospital in October 2011. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed that the calcified mass measuring 19 × 8 mm was located between the P2 and P3 areas of the posterior mitral valve leaflet. There was no mitral regurgitation, and her ejection fraction was 67%. There were no findings suggestive of infectious endocarditis (Figure ). On cardiac catheterization, the coronary arteries were intact without an obvious thrombo-occlusive lesion. Computed tomograms (CT) confirmed the severe calcified mass on the posterior mitral valve leaflet (Figure ). Laboratory examinations were unremarkable.\nBecause there was potential risk of thromboembolism, surgical intervention was indicated for the calcified mass or tumor on the mitral valve. Definitive diagnosis was also expected after surgical excision of the mass.\nThe patient underwent surgical removal of the mass with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass. The mitral valve was inspected through a right-sided left atrial incision. A round mass was originating from the P2 area and measured 8 mm in diameter. The calcified process was localized to the posterior leaflet itself. The entire mass was excised and submitted for histopathological examination.

The initial peritoneal equilibration test (PET) test revealed a low transporter status and he had good ultrafiltration. After 3 months of being on CAPD, he underwent a live related renal transplantation at the age of 7 years with the mother as the donor. Unfortunately, he had primary graft failure due to thrombosis of graft renal artery, and he continued CAPD. After about 18 months, he had an episode of fungal peritonitis with candida albicans isolated on culture. CAPD catheter was removed, and he was initiated on hemodialysis via right internal jugular tunneled catheter. After about 5 months, he developed catheter-related blood stream infection not responding to antibiotic therapy requiring removal of hemodialysis catheter, and he was reinitiated on CAPD. Despite four exchanges with 1 L dwell volume, he remained fluid overloaded and the PET test repeated showed high transporter status. Since he had no permanent vascular access, he continued to be on CAPD with fluid restriction and high dose diuretics with occasional hemodialysis support through temporary vascular access. After 54 months of peritoneal dialysis, he started experiencing abdominal symptoms in the form of intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, weight loss with abdominal distension. Ultrasound scan of the abdomen revealed moderate ascites with septations. The ascitic fluid study revealed exudative ascites and predominant lymphocytes with negative adenosine deaminase. Antituberculous therapy was started as tuberculosis is highly prevalent and has a similar presentation. CAPD was discontinued, and he was started on hemodialysis. After 2 months of antituberculous therapy, the patient continued to be symptomatic with progressive abdominal pain and abdominal distension.

Physical examination revealed gaseous abdominal distention without tenderness or mass. He had a history of 2 laparotomies in the past both for small bowel obstruction secondary to enterolith impaction that had failed to resolve with conservative measures.\nThe finding on first operation 3 years ago was that of a 3 × 5 cm obstructing enterolith in the ileum 20 cm proximal to the ileocaecal junction. This was removed through an enterotomy and the affected segment of ileum was resected with primary end to end anastomosis. There were no diverticula or any other inciting factors identified. The histopathology of the resected small bowel was reported to have no specific findings.\nFollowing this, he presented 2 years later with similar symptoms. On second operation the findings were again similar to that of the first operation with an impacted enterolith in the mid ileum along with minimal adhesions. He underwent enterotomy and removal of the enterolith. Following the second operation he was asymptomatic till this presentation.\nAt the current presentation, his hematological and biochemical workup was normal and abdominal radiographs were inconclusive.

She had a history of minor trauma involving bruising of the finger in a door and was referred to a neighboring clinic 14 months before the visit to our hospital. Plain radiographs taken at the previous clinic had shown no sign of fracture, but instead revealed an abnormal calcifying lesion of the soft tissue of the left fifth finger. She had visited several clinics and hospitals and had been treated with analgesics and splinting for more than 2 months, but the pain in the finger had gradually worsened. Thus, she was referred to our hospital for definitive diagnosis and treatment.\nPhysical examination revealed tenderness around the PIP joint of the fifth finger with an apparent subcutaneous tumor, measuring around 1 cm in diameter (Figs. A and B). She experienced pain around the PIP joint of the fifth finger when the fist was tightly clenched and/or when the lesion contacted another object. There were no signs of infection or neurovascular disturbances, and no history of previous infection. The range of motion of the affected PIP joint was slightly more restricted than that of the contralateral side, but there was no functional impairment of the finger.

{"note": "A 22-year-old male patient, a labour worker by occupation, had presented to our outpatient department with a diagnosis of concomitant nonunion of the shaft and neck of the left femur of eight months duration. On the basis of history and previous records, it was known that the patient had sustained an open grade IIIA fracture of shaft femur and a closed ipsilateral femoral neck fracture of the left side following road traffic eight months prior to the above presentation. The femoral shaft fracture was managed with an external fixator application, and the femoral neck fracture management was delayed due to unhealthy soft tissue conditions around the proximal lateral aspect of the thigh. The treatment of both fractures was further delayed because the patient developed an infection of the open wound of the femoral shaft fracture. To add to the complications, he had developed pin site infection as well. Following that, open debridement of the femoral shaft wound site was performed, and the external fixator was removed at the primary treating institution. Thereafter, the limb was kept splinted on a Thomas splint. Subsequently, the wound and pin sites were healed and the patient was referred to our center, which is a tertiary care center and teaching medical institute, after a total duration of eight months following injury. Clinicoradiological examination confirmed the non-union of the left femoral shaft fracture and ipsilateral femoral neck fracture (Figure ). Blood investigations revealed raised serum inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)=25 mm/hr and C-reactive protein (CRP)=12 g/L). However, there were no clinical signs of local inflammation around the fracture sites, the healed wound, and the pin sites. An MRI evaluation of the hip joint and the affected thigh was planned but was deferred as the patient was claustrophobic and not comfortable.

On admission, physical examination revealed a firm mass in the lower abdomen with no pain or tenderness, and she was referred to our department for further treatment.\nComputed tomography revealed a mass measuring 28 × 18 × 30 mm in the subcutaneous tissue (). She had injected insulin into the abdomen near the mass. We suspected that this was a skin-related complication of insulin therapy, and the patient was instructed to refrain from injecting insulin into the mass. To confirm the diagnosis, we planned excision of the mass. However, several days later, she fell on the floor and sustained right femoral neck fracture. She was admitted to the Orthopedic Department for surgical treatment, and excision of the mass was postponed. During this hospitalization, the floor nurses supervised her insulin injection. Her blood glucose control improved rapidly, and she had experienced hypoglycemia several times. Two months after visiting our department, her HbA1c was 7.8% and daily insulin dose was decreased to 33 units. She was discharged from our hospital, but she had not visited our department at that time.\nFour years later, she was admitted to the Internal Medicine Department because of renal anemia and referred to our department again due to the same mass in the lower abdomen, which was suspected to be a malignant soft tissue tumor.

The initial pathology report indicated squamous cell carcinoma. After nearly 6 years of being disease-free, he noted a new lesion on the same spot, which had disseminated and involved almost all scalp tissue within one month. On magnetic resonance imaging, a vegetative and enhancing mass over the right parietal bone measuring 74 mm × 74 mm × 38 mm was noted, with suspicious invasion to the external table of bone and adjacent bone marrow. Multiple suspicious lymphadenopathies on the left cervical levels 2 and 5 as well as the left occipital and parotid regions were reported with short axis diameter (SAD) of about 10 mm. A core needle biopsy of suspicious lymph nodes indicated squamous cell carcinoma and later, the patient underwent an extensive scalp surgery for resection of the lesions. The skin defect was covered with a rotational flap and skin grafting.\nThe surgical pathology report indicated a 9-centimeter large tumor with 2.5 cm thickness, and the tumor was classified as poorly differentiated SCC. The tumor showed lymphovascular invasive features, but perineural invasion was not detected. Deep margin of the excised tissue was affected by the tumor; however, bone trabeculae and intervening marrow were not involved. The surgeon additionally resected two other suspicious lesions on the right frontal and left parietal regions of the scalp. The former was reported to be actinic keratosis grade 3 (Bowen’s disease), while the latter showed features of early invasive SCC in a background of actinic keratosis with a thickness of 2.2 mm and close medial margin (3 mm).\nWe intended to treat the patient with adjuvant radiotherapy to a total dose of 66 Gy with 6 MV photons.

She had a history of ovarian tumor 25 years ago and thyroid tumor 5 years ago, both of which healed after surgical resection.\nPhysical examination revealed a mass 5 × 3 cm in the ulnar side of her left proximal forearm shown in Figure . The lesion was firm, nonpulsatile, and tender on palpitation. She had numbness on the ulnar side of her left hand and fingers. The 2-point discrimination test revealed that 15 mm at the lateral side of the ring finger 10 mm at the little finger. She had muscle weakness with abduction and adduction of the ring finger and the little finger, but no deficit in the range of motion in the elbow. The electrophysiological study revealed a significant decrease in the motor nerve conduction velocity of the ulnar nerve from distal to the mass to proximal to the mass. MRI revealed that the ulnar nerve was swollen longitudinally, had a spindle shape, and measured 3.0 × 2.7 cm in the axial plane and 7.2 cm longitudinally shown in Figure . The swollen lesion had a relatively homogeneous isosignal intensity on T1-weighted images and had relative heterogeneous enhancement after the intravenous administration of gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agent with the findings of flow void. Based on these findings, the differential diagnoses included a vascular malformation that surrounded and compressed the ulnar nerve. Excisional biopsy was not performed because of the risk of hemorrhage and iatrogenic nerve injury. The lesion was instead surgically explored with a longitudinal incision shown in Figure .

The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan, and bronchoscopy, and was found to have a 9 mm fatty endobronchial lesion in the bronchus intermedius above the middle lobe with 2 cm extraluminal fatty lesion into the right hilum. An endobronchial ultrasound with biopsy of the mass was performed, which showed benign bronchial epithelial cells. Since endobronchial resection of the mass would lead to a large defect in the right bronchus intermedius, the decision was made to perform robotic-assisted resection of the lesion (Video ).\nWe used the Da Vinci Xi robot to perform resection of the endobronchial lesion and hilar mass with right lower lobe superior segmentectomy to remove the lesion. The patient had a “five on a dice” port placement for the operation [, ]. First, we performed the right lower lobe superior segmentectomy to obtain adequate exposure of the hilar mass. We mobilized the superior segmental branch of pulmonary artery and superior segmental branch of the right lower lobe going to the inferior pulmonary vein and divided them with the vascular robot stapler. We divided the superior segmental branch of right lower lobe bronchus with the robot blue load stapler. We used indocyanine green angiography to define the borders of the superior segment of the right lower lobe, which was divided using the robot blue load stapler. This provided access to the hilar fatty tumor, which allowed for removal of the hilar mass and subsequent resection of endobronchial lesion with scissors. The frozen section on both lesions was negative for malignancy. We confirmed complete resection with intraoperative bronchoscopy that also showed a large opening in the airway.\nIn order to reconstruct the airway, we placed two 3-0 vicryl stay sutures at the proximal and distal ends of the airway and placed the suture through the posterior ports to pull the airway posteriorly away from the"}

The initial neurological exam showed an upper right limb paresis, and the rest of the exam was normal. The patient had no recent travels, and lived with his wife and a son. The patient referred had no recent trauma to the head or the neck or any type of vehicle accident.\nThe initial clinical suspicion was a spinal cord compression at the upper cervical spinal cord, primarily due to the neck pain and the upper limb paresis that locate the lesion in this particular area.\nA noncontrast Computed Tomography (CT) was obtained to evaluate spine integrity (). A mass at the level of the odontoid process was seen with density similar to bone that corresponded to an old fracture of the odontoid process. Due to the changes noted in the density of the bone, the fracture has healed as pseudarthrosis. An important cervical canal stenosis was noted and immediately the patient was put in a rigid cervical collar to prevent any further damages to the spinal cord.\nDue to the high risk of myelopathy, Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) of the cervical spine was ordered (). Signs of myelopathy are seen behind the mass of bone that was detected in the CT at the C1-C2 spinal cord levels, confirming the images on the CT that the fracture was in fact an old one, and the clinical signs of the patient were due to this injury in the spinal cord.\nOn a thoroughly second interrogation, the patient revealed a motorcycle accident that happened 23 years before this visit and listed a scalp laceration as the sole injury he had sustained at that time.\nThe patient was admitted for immediate surgery"}

According to the emergency physician’s report, the patient was taken to the hospital about 3 h after the injury. The patient was on the way to the hospital with a fixed right pupil, so he was given mannitol timely in the ambulance. We speculated that the duration of brain herniation was at least 1 h. He was hemodynamically stable and intubated, there were two adjacent bullet holes in the patient’s right frontal area, and no ballistic exit was seen. Neurological examination revealed that his right pupil was fixed and dilated, and his left pupil was 2.5-mm wide and reactive. He was responsive to pain stimuli but not to verbal stimuli. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head revealed a bullet trajectory with a right frontal comminuted fracture and bony and metallic fragments in the right frontal and right occipital lobes. There was also some brain tissue swelling with a midline shift to the left and subarachnoid hemorrhage (Fig. ). Since the patient had a brain herniation at admission, he was immediately transferred to the operating room for debridement and decompressive craniectomy after the first CT scan. Considering the specificity of the patient’s intracranial hematoma location and foreign body location, we performed an extended pterional approach and decompressive craniectomy in time. We did not temporarily remove the foreign body in the occipital lobe but waited for the patient’s vital signs to stabilize after the first operation and then evaluated whether it was suitable for removal or maintenance. The analysis of why this decision was taken is presented in detail in the surgical management section. The patient recovered well after the first operation with no infection or brain abscess development and underwent a second operation 2 weeks later to remove the foreign body in the occipital lobe (Fig. ).

{"note": "Three hours after being shot in the back, a 29-year-old Albanian man was admitted to the Surgical Department of our Emergency Center. An examination revealed two small caliber bullet holes over his thoracolumbar spine and sacrum, paraplegia and absence of the pulses. The deteriorating condition of our patient led to the decision to surgically explore his abdomen. No injuries to the viscera were found. A small retroperitoneal hematoma on his right side was opened. His pulse over his common iliac arteries was normal and there was no active bleeding at the area. Drains were placed and his abdomen was closed in layers. Because of an insufficient improvement of the monitored parameters, our patient was intubated and transferred to our intensive care unit for further resuscitation. Three hours later he developed ischemia in his left leg. His leg was cold, with no pulse up to the common femoral artery and there were signs of discoloration. Computed tomography of his chest and abdomen revealed two bullets - one in his left iliac fossa and a second in front of his sacrum (Figure ). Color Doppler imaging revealed an obstruction of the external iliac artery on his left side. No free fluid was found in his abdomen. There was also a multiple fracture of his twelfth thoracic and first lumbar vertebrae with no free fluids in his abdomen (Figure ). These findings alerted the vascular surgery team and after a consultation, a tentative diagnosis of a gunshot injury was made. The decision was made to re-enter the abdomen.\nA second surgery was performed eight hours after the first one. At his left iliac fossa no significant hematoma was noted. However, there was no pulse over his external iliac artery. After the division of the surrounding tissues it was possible to feel the obstructing foreign body within the common iliac artery. Once vascular control was obtained the artery was opened and the bullet removed (Figure and ). The embolectomy of the distal arteries was performed using a Fogarty catheter"}
{"note": "The patient was a 21-year-old male with bilateral cleft lip. Severe cleft lip nose deformity, i.e. a short bridge and flat apex of the nose, were observed. Under general anesthesia, the nasal morphology was improved using cartilage of the nasal septum, and the lip deformity was improved by forming a tubercle of the upper lip using a lip switch flap with left inferior labial arterial and venous pedicles, the philtrum and bridge of the nose. The lower lip flap was designed to have a ∼10-mm width and a ∼17-mm length and transplanted to the upper lip. Its color immediately after surgery was favorable (), but marked swelling of the flap and surrounding tissue was noted 6 h after surgery, with which the flap developed venous congestion (). To release pressure due to the swelling on the vascular pedicle, sutures around the pedicle were removed, but blood circulation of the flap did not improve and congestion aggravated. Since flap necrosis was predicted, the flap that had been transplanted to the upper lip was returned to the lower lip 8 h after surgery to improve its blood circulation and prevent necrosis. Under venous sedation, the flap transplanted to the upper lip was released to a free state so that the mouth could be opened, oropharyngeal intubation was applied and sedation was switched to general anesthesia. Hematoma around the flap was removed by washing well with saline. After confirming blood flow from the flap stump, the flap was returned to the lower lip and fixed by sutures, and the transplantation site was simply sutured ().\nAfter surgery, the flap was covered with heparinized saline-soaked gauze to further reduce congestion. Congestion was improved 7 h after surgery (), and the flap returned to the donor site had almost completely recovered 1 week after surgery (). The flap was re-transplanted with sufficient tissue around the pedicle under local anesthesia (). Flap engraftment was favorable, and it was transected after 9 days.

He was brought to our hospital about 2 h after the accident. The right lower limb had a severe comminution and bone loss at the knee joint, with the loss of skin and soft- tissue and crushing of muscle above and below the knee [Figures and ]. The left forefoot was completely degloved and all the toes were crushed and degloved as well [Figures and ].\nThe right lower limb was deemed not replantable as the knee joint was severely damaged and not salvageable, In addition, debridement of crushed and devitalized tissues would result in a 15-20 cm shortening and a limb that was at least 15 cm short with fused knee joint would not be functionally useful and primary insertion of prosthetic knee joint was not considered to be feasible by the attending orthopaedic surgeon.\nFocus was then shifted to the crushed left foot with a view to perform immediate debridement and early soft-tissue cover, to salvage as much of the foot as possible and get it fully healed and weight bearing at the earliest. Stable and sensate skin cover were vital, as this would be the only surviving foot. A large defect such as this would require a large distant flap or even two flaps. Best replacement for skin on the foot was anatomically identical skin from the opposite foot, which in this case was provided by the well-preserved amputated limb. The general condition of the patient was stable and he had no other life-threatening injuries. Immediate double free tissue transfer from the amputated limb was done.

His tongue mobility was normal and there was no palpable cervical lymphadenopathy.\nSystematic examination of chest, abdomen and heart were normal. The lesion was biopsied and initially reported as a primary squamous cell carcinoma with some clear cell changes. His blood tests including renal functions were normal. His case was discussed in the head and neck cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting and subtotal glossectomy was planned after a staging MRI (magnetic resonant imaging) scan followed by adjuvant radiotherapy to the head and neck region. While awaiting an MRI, he presented to the hospital with severe pain in his oral cavity and difficulty in swallowing. His tongue lesion had doubled in size in a matter of two weeks and was now protruding outside the mouth (Figure ). It was considered unusual for primary squamous cell carcinoma of tongue to behave like that. The pathology was therefore reviewed at the same MDT meeting and this time the lesion was reported as partly squamous epithelium covered by fibromuscular tissue showing infiltration by a carcinoma, seen in the nests with extensive clear cell changes. The differential diagnosis was considered to be squamous cell carcinoma with clear cell changes, metastatic salivary gland neoplasm or metastases from RCC. It was decided to arrange an urgent CT scan and to debulk the tongue lesion surgically, to improve his symptoms. The patient had not described any suspicious urinary symptoms.\nA CT scan of the neck, chest and abdomen revealed a 4.7-cm sized irregular mass in the left kidney suggestive of RCC (Figure ). There was no local extension and the left renal vein was clear. A solitary tongue lesion with no"}

MRI scan of the brain showed pachymeningeal enhancement and a progressive acquired Chiari malformation in keeping with findings of intracranial hypotension [ and ]. The intracranial hypotension was idiopathic as the patient had not had any trauma, fractures, surgery, or lumbar puncture before the onset of her orthostatic headaches. No abnormalities were noted on her physical examination including the fundus examination. Multiple MRI scans of the brain and spinal cord were done to identify the source of the leak, but the source could not be identified. The patient was given dexamethasone 1.5 mg daily to help with the headaches and an epidural blood patch was done. After the failure of the first blood patch, the patient underwent two more epidural blood patches and dihydroergotamine mesylate 0.3 mg IV every 8 h for 72 h was started for symptomatic relief. Dihydroergotamine mesylate resulted in symptomatic relief for the first 5 hours but the headache reoccurred in the 3 hours before the next dose. The blood patches resulted in a mild reduction in the severity of her headaches but did not completely resolve the symptoms. The patient also developed a headache above the left eye with blurry vision after the third blood patch that resolved after 1.5 weeks. The patient was reluctant to have any further blood patches after this experience. A CT myelogram of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine was done to identify the source of the leak but was found to be negative. Dexamethasone 1.5 mg and oxycodone/ acetaminophen 2.5 mg every 4 hours were the only two agents that provided any persistent improvements in her symptoms. The patient was admitted to the hospital due to intractable vomiting secondary to her headaches on several occasions. Ondansetron 8 mg PO before meal 3 times a day improved her nausea and vomiting. Pharmacological treatments for the headaches proved to be ineffective and an MRI of the"}

Her blood pressure was 62/37 mm Hg on arrival, and she was admitted to our critical care center. She had only mild abdominal pain despite abdominal distension. Her face was pale, and there was weak palpation of the radial artery. The patient's hemoglobin level at admission was 12.4 g/dL. A venous sheath was inserted in the left femoral vein, and rapid infusion by crystalloid fluid of approximately 1000 mL was initiated in the resuscitation room. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan was performed after confirming increased blood pressure; this revealed a ruptured PDA aneurysm and celiac axis stenosis that was compressed by the median arcuate ligament (Figure ). We decided to perform transarterial embolization (TAE) as an endovascular treatment. The patient was anesthetized and underwent oral intubation followed by transfer to the emergency angiography room.\nThe patient's blood pressure suddenly dropped, and she developed hemodynamic shock. Her hemoglobin level dropped to 7.3 g/dL. It was difficult to secure the right femoral artery because the patient was obese. The pulse was weak, and the artery had collapsed as a result of the hemorrhagic shock. After several times to puncture the artery, she developed a subcutaneous hematoma and local arterial dissection was suspected. We attempted to access the left femoral artery; however, this too was difficult to secure. The blood pressure declined gradually, and prompt management to control the hemodynamics became necessary. We decided that the treatment was difficult with interventional radiology and it was necessary to switch to surgical treatment. We also believed that performing REBOA promptly would be more important to maintain the hemodynamics until a surgical intervention can be performed. Surgical exposure of the left femoral artery was performed to insert an aortic balloon occlusion catheter.\nCeliac artery arteriography was performed to confirm the point of rupture before inserting the balloon catheter (Figure ). The position of the aortic balloon was confirmed using fluoroscopy, and inflation of the balloon"}

A threatened premature labor was diagnosed. Ultrasound showed a female fetus with normal development and amniotic fluid volume. Small bowel appeared mildly dilated (14 mm) with thickened and hyperechogenic intestinal wall. There was a typical whirlpool configuration of the bowel (). First and second trimester ultrasounds were unremarkable. Screening for infectious diseases was negative. A molecular genetic testing of CFTR was realized in the parents who were tested for the 32 main mutations of CFTR during a genetic counseling. This testing was negative in both of the parents. So, the fetus was not screened for cystic fibrosis. The patient received atosiban for tocolysis and steroids for fetal lung maturation. Ultrasound follow-up one week later and every two weeks showed absence of significant modification in small bowel dilatation and normal fetal development and amniotic fluid volume up to 33 weeks and 1 day of gestation when a peritoneal calcification appeared leading to the suspicion of meconium peritonitis. Fetal biometry measures including the abdominal circumference and amniotic fluid volume were normal throughout the follow-up in antepartum period. Ultrasound follow-up at 36 weeks and 4 days of gestation revealed a significant aggravation of intestinal dilatation (30 mm) appearing more extensively with persistent intestinal peristalsis, and some parietal calcifications appeared with a meconium pseudocyst but there were no ascites (). Fetal vitality was good with a satisfying Manning's score; there were neither ascites nor significant increasing in abdominal circumference nor abnormality in fetal heart rate and the amniotic fluid volume was normal. So, the patient was hospitalized for close monitoring of fetal heart rate. After consultation with members of pediatric surgery team, induction of labor was decided at 37 weeks and 2 days of gestation given the worsening ultrasound images associated with reduced fetal movements and reduced fetal heart rate variability for neonatal surgical management. Furthermore, the patient had a favorable B"}

The patient had no other complaints associated with the wound. The wound had appeared initially as a swelling which burst spontaneously after taking antibiotics, 6 months ago. Since then the patient had been undergoing treatment in the form of antibiotic and anti-inflammatory agents off and on with regular dressings. The discharge used to reduce while the patient took the medication but increased again after stopping therapy. There was no history of associated abdominal pain, bowel complaints, or urinary disturbances. The patient gave history of trauma to the left leg 1 year back leading to fracture of the neck of femur for which he underwent placement of a hip screw. Examination revealed a single wound on the left lumbar region [] associated with mucoid discharge. There was no surrounding erythema or tenderness and the abdominal examination was essentially normal. Urine culture grew E. coli sensitive to nitrofurantoin, and was repeated after 1 week of therapy to ensure sterility of the urinary tract. An X-ray of the abdomen and KUB region was suggestive of a solitary renal calculus and a radio-opaque hip screw in the left hip joint. A sinogram was performed using 60% urograffin which revealed a complex fistula communicating with the left pelvicalyceal system []. An intravenous pyelogram performed with the intent of assessing the functional status of the kidney showed a non-functioning left kidney with a solitary pelvic calculus on the left side and a normally functioning kidney on the right side. A renal nuclear scan with DTPA showed poor left-side function with a GFR of 8 ml/min and a differential function of 11%. Based on these findings the patient was planned for nephrectomy and excision of the sinus tract.

Seventeen years prior, she had an emergency TV replacement with a St Jude bileaflet tilting disc prosthetic valve for bacterial endocarditis of her TV. The reasons for choosing a mechanical valve at that time are not known. Anticoagulation with warfarin without an antiplatelet agent was maintained and managed largely by our patient along with her primary care doctor. After her TV replacement she had three episodes of TV thrombosis, for which she received thrombolytics. Two of these episodes occurred during the discontinuation of warfarin and initiation of heparin or low molecular weight heparin for pregnancy, necessitating the termination of her pregnancies. Her international normalized ratio on admission was at a therapeutic level of 2.5; heparin was initiated with a goal prothrombin time of 80 seconds and warfarin discontinued for the gynecologic surgery. A preoperative echocardiogram showed a mean gradient across the TV of 5 mmHg.\nOur patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, oophorectomy, removal of an ovarian mass and a cystotomy repair. The surgery was four hours long and she had 400 cm3 of blood loss. Heparin was off for a total of 13 hours. On postoperative day one, our patient complained that she could not hear the click of her mechanical valve. She was hemodynamically stable with a heart rate of 105 beats per minute. Doppler echocardiography showed a mean TV gradient of 18 mmHg (Figure ). A transesophageal echo showed the St Jude valve to be stuck in the open position. This was confirmed by fluoroscopy (Figure and ).\nThrombolytics were not an option as she was in a recent postoperative state. She was maintained under close observation and serial echocardiograms showed that the gradients across her TV remained stable. Limited blood testing did not show any disorders in blood coagulation.

The patient was extremely unhappy with existing transitional, removable partial denture due to its poor stability, especially during speech and mastication. He gave a history of teeth extraction six months before due to mobility. He also reported on chronic mouth breathing due to enlarged adenoids and blocked nasal breathing, which was surgically treated a year back. The patient gave a graphic history of continued, progressive labial flaring of anterior teeth that subsequently became mobile to be extracted. On examination, it was observed that the patient had lost both maxillary central incisors and all four mandibular incisors (). The adjacent maxillary lateral incisors showed slight labial flaring and grade 1 mobility; intraoral periapical X-ray confirmed approximately 20–25% alveolar bone loss. Routine TMJ examination showed no signs of pathology. The patency of nasal airways were checked by requesting to close the lip together and occluding one naris with the index finger alternatively. Ask the patient to breathe normally through open naris. The tongue movements were within normal limits. The evaluation of swallowing process without the removable prosthesis showed slight space between posterior teeth and minor hyperactivity of orbicularis oris and mentalis muscles. On complete evaluation of clinical signs symptoms along with clinical examination, it was diagnosed as loss of maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth due to combined effect of periodontal diseases, chronic mouth breathing, and tongue thrusting.\nThe treatment objectives were to replace the missing maxillary and mandibular central incisors along with rehabilitation of tongue thrusting habit. Treatment options to replace the missing anterior teeth was discussed with the patient, including the implant supported fixed prosthesis. The tooth that supported conventional fixed partial denture was selected according to the patient desire. The potential abutments were evaluated by the clinical and radiological examination to ascertain periodontal and pulpal health. The intentional root canal treatment was performed on maxillary right lateral incisors to gain common path of"}
{"note": "A 78-year-old male patient with coronary artery disease status post coronary stent placement was found to have a lung nodule on the chest radiograph at that time. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan, and bronchoscopy, and was found to have a 9 mm fatty endobronchial lesion in the bronchus intermedius above the middle lobe with 2 cm extraluminal fatty lesion into the right hilum. An endobronchial ultrasound with biopsy of the mass was performed, which showed benign bronchial epithelial cells. Since endobronchial resection of the mass would lead to a large defect in the right bronchus intermedius, the decision was made to perform robotic-assisted resection of the lesion (Video ).\nWe used the Da Vinci Xi robot to perform resection of the endobronchial lesion and hilar mass with right lower lobe superior segmentectomy to remove the lesion. The patient had a “five on a dice” port placement for the operation [, ]. First, we performed the right lower lobe superior segmentectomy to obtain adequate exposure of the hilar mass. We mobilized the superior segmental branch of pulmonary artery and superior segmental branch of the right lower lobe going to the inferior pulmonary vein and divided them with the vascular robot stapler. We divided the superior segmental branch of right lower lobe bronchus with the robot blue load stapler. We used indocyanine green angiography to define the borders of the superior segment of the right lower lobe, which was divided using the robot blue load stapler. This provided access to the hilar fatty tumor, which allowed for removal of the hilar mass and subsequent resection of endobronchial lesion with scissors. The frozen section on both lesions was negative for malignancy. We confirmed complete resection with intraoperative bronchoscopy that also showed a large opening in the airway.\nIn order to reconstruct the airway, we placed two 3-0 vicryl stay sutures at the proximal and distal ends of the airway and placed the suture through the posterior ports to pull the airway posteriorly away from the"}

Her systolic blood pressure exceeded 200 mmHg in the office, and aggressive medical therapy was initiated in the outpatient setting. She returned to the emergency department the following day with headache and malaise and systolic blood pressure above 200 mmHg for which she was treated and discharged.\nShe returned to the emergency department again 5 days later, this time with complaints of word finding difficulty, blurred vision, and lower extremity tingling. Her blood pressure on presentation was 216/81 mmHg. She was admitted, and workup demonstrated no acute intracranial process or carotid stenosis. Echocardiography revealed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with a preserved ejection fraction. Her blood pressure continued to be refractory to medical therapy despite five antihypertensive agents and eventual initiation of an esmolol infusion. A renal artery ultrasound identified renal artery stenosis with flow at the arterial origin measuring 350 cm/s on the right and 208 cm/s on the left (); flow velocity in the supraceliac aorta was also noted to be elevated. She had no history of kidney disease and no elevation of her creatinine. Vascular surgery was consulted and a history of lower extremity claudication was elicited. On exam she had weak but palpable femoral pulses and an audible abdominal aortic bruit; ankle-brachial index measurements were deferred and the patient was scheduled for angiogram.\nThe patient underwent aortography the following day and on selective angiography the renal arteries were found to be widely patent. Significant stenosis was identified at the distal thoracic aorta extending into the abdominal aorta but terminating proximal to the celiac trunk. The degree of stenosis was deemed to be greater than 90% and a pressure gradient between the upper extremity and intra-aortic measurements exceeded 100 mmHg.

Patient underwent a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor. The pathology report confirmed a pT2 muscle invasive bladder cancer. The computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis was negative for metastases. After 10 days the patient was subjected to a radical cystoprostatectomy and urinary diversion to an orthotopic ileal neobladder with a modified S-pouch. The final pathology report described a tumor to the posterior wall and the dome of the bladder. The prostate, the seminal vesicles, the distal ureters, and the lymph nodes were free of cancer involvement. The surgical margins were also negative. Patient did not receive chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. The patient 8 months postoperatively complained of left thigh pain and a palpable mass. Thereafter, a full body MRI was performed and revealed a lesion of about 8 cm in diameter in the upper portion of the sartorius muscle, with no other abnormalities or metastatic sites.\nThe patient underwent surgical resection of the lesion after induction of general anesthesia. The mass involved only the muscular plane of the sartorius, 10 cm approximately from the origin without evident contact with the tendon or adjacent muscle. A marginal excision of the lesion was performed. Macroscopically, it was an 8 × 4 × 4 cm lesion with smooth margins and the cross-section was white and shiny (Figures and ). The postoperative period was uneventful. The pathology of the lesion reported a 9 × 4 × 3,9 cm skeletal muscle with a solid lesion of a maximal diameter of 7,2 cm. The skeletal muscle was infiltrated from a malignant lesion compatible with a high grade urothelial carcinoma positive to the CK7 marker and negative to the CK20 ().

The patient had a history of thyroid follicular adenocarcinoma which was treated surgically with total thyroidectomy and postoperative iodine treatment 25 years prior to presentation. At 12 years post thyroidectomy, she was diagnosed with a calcaneal mass of the same pathology and diagnosed with delayed distant thyroid carcinoma metastasis to the calcaneus. 10 years after calcaneal mass excision, the patient was diagnosed with a proximal tibial mass that turned out to be also delayed metastasis of the same pathology.\nAt the first presentation 15 years ago, she initially presented complaining of mild edema of the left ankle with intermittent pain upon daily activity. Physical exam showed full range of motion of the ankle joint with intact motor power and intact neurovascular status. There were no cutaneous lesions.\nPlain radiographs of the left ankle showed a 3-centimeter oval lytic lesion in the anterior aspect of the calcaneum ().\nAn MRI of the left ankle showed a 3.2 cm well-defined benign-looking lytic lesion of the calcaneal neck reaching the cortex which appeared to be mildly irregular with mild degenerative disease of the posterior subtalar joint consistent with an intraosseous ganglion cyst of the calcaneus ().\nMedical treatment with NSAIDs and paracetamol was initiated, along with partial weight bearing and relative rest with no improvement at follow-up at 4 weeks. Surgical intervention was decided due to the persistent pain. The cyst was resected with a margin of surrounding fibro-osseous tissue and the bone grafted. Histopathological evaluation revealed a metastatic carcinoma of the thyroid gland. Immunostaining showed that the cells expressed cytokeratin, cytokeratin 7, and thyroglobulin, all of which confirm the diagnosis ().\nFor further confirmation, the recently excised cyst slides were compared to the pathology slides of the thyroid excision undertaken 12 years prior to the calcaneal presentation and were found out to be of the same pathology ().\nThe patient had"}

The medical history of the boy included a mild pulmonary valve stenosis and a secundum atrial septal defect with a left-right shunt. He showed a good physical and cardiac fitness and a normal nutritional status. The family history was positive for maxillofacial anomalies: the boy's older sister had been previously diagnosed with a dysplastic fibroma, a rare benign fibrovascular defect in the mandible, and a resection of the affected area in the mandible had been performed. His father and paternal grandmother had a positive history of odontogenic cysts as well as basal cell carcinomas, although the family history of OKCs was negative. The radiological examination showed three suspicious hypomineralisations visible as radiolucencies in the panoramic radiograph associated with the retained teeth 13 and 23 and the ectopic tooth 27 (). The young patient was referred to the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery for a surgical examination of the radiologic anomalies.\nThe operation was performed under general anesthesia. The suspected pathological area around teeth 23 and 13 showed no visible intraoperative pathological signs. A bone and soft tissue biopsy for histological examination was taken. In the area of tooth 27, a well-marked membrane was revealed, filled with a viscid fluid and fully enclosing the dental crown. The clinical aspect was consistent with a follicular cyst. During the radical cystectomy, tooth 27 was removed due to massive attachment loss. The histopathological biopsy showed a fibroosseous lesion in the area of teeth 13 and 23.

When he arrived at our hospital, the rusted iron bars penetrated through his forehead bilaterally. On the right side, the bar penetrated on the forehead in a downward angle running along the cheek and exiting through right ear, and on the left side, the bar out through the left mandible angle (, ). Intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics were started and tetanus vaccination with tetanus immunoglobulin was injected. He was fully drunken but conscious and had no sign and symptom of brain and facial nerve injury. Facial bone and neck computed tomography (CT) scan revealed that there was no penetration of facial bone or skull, no injury of major vascular, and organ injury of face such as parotid glands.

{"note": "A 72-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of an abnormal pulmonary shadow found on a routine chest X-ray. Chest X-rays revealed a mass shadow in the left middle lung field and a positive silhouette sign for the left second arch (Fig. ). The aortic arch aneurysm was saccular aneurysm associated with a greater risk of rupture, and connected to the pulmonary mass in the left upper lobe with a possible risk of tumor adhesion or invasion to the aneurysm (Fig. ). Three-dimensional CT revealed that the aortic aneurysm was located in front of the arch near the left subclavian artery, and the brachiocephalic and left common carotid arteries branched from the aorta with a common duct (Fig. ). These findings led to the diagnosis of aortic arch aneurysm and lung carcinoma. There were no distant metastases of the lung carcinoma (clinical stage T2bN0M0 stage IIA). We decided to perform left upper lobectomy and patch angioplasty if the arch of aorta between the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery could be temporarily occluded. If not, we planned to perform aortic arch replacement under selective cerebral perfusion with systemic extracorporeal circulation through the groin.\nA fourth intercostal thoracotomy was performed. As the lung carcinoma adhered to the aortic arch aneurysm but did not invade it, we could detach the visceral pleura of the left upper lobe from the aortic arch aneurysm. We performed left upper lobectomy. After that, we confirmed that the aneurysm was proximal to the left subclavian artery. Because of the position of the TAA, it was difficult to perform patch angioplasty. We decided to perform aortic arch replacement for the aortic arch aneurysm with a 3-branched artificial vessel under selective cerebral perfusion with systemic extracorporeal circulation. The thoracotomy was extended to the right with a transverse incision of the sternum.\nA 30-mm intimal defect was observed in the aorta, and half of the aneurysm was filled with organized thrombus.

He started to experience dizziness after traveling in airplanes prior to the beginning of this study. He noticed a significant body shift while walking and increased dizziness. His dizziness was most severe in extremely light or dark conditions. He found himself becoming increasingly afraid to drive. In particular, he was most anxious about driving his vehicle in heavy traffic or on narrow streets. He found that he was not able to pay immediate attention to traffic when turning around to look over his shoulder and then turning back to the road ahead. As a result, he had to give up most independent travel and came to rely on his family members to provide transportation for him. Because of his symptoms, the patient was depressed, had low self-confidence and was disappointed with his ability to perform his daily activities. His primary goal was to be able to return to safely driving a motor vehicle. The caloric test results 1 week prior to the study showed a left-sided canal paresis of 28%.\nThe patient was under a considerable amount of stress, and his training progress was relatively slow. By the time he returned home after the 1st week of training, his family members reported that his body shift while walking had increased. His body shift had significantly improved by the 2nd week of training. At this point, the patient began riding a motorcycle and driving around the neighborhood. He started to experience discomfort and dizziness when checking over his shoulder for oncoming cars. Because of these symptoms, he immediately gave up this initial driving attempt. By the 3rd and 4th weeks of training, he experienced less frequent episodes of severe dizziness. He began to ride his bicycle or motor vehicle on wide streets in his neighborhood. However, he still experienced dizziness when exposed to intense light. By the end of the 6th week of training,"}

The character and intensity of the pain were not affected by changes in physical movement or by rest. He denied any other symptoms such as fever, nausea, dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and leg numbness during his clinical course.\nHe had a past medical history of rectal cancer with liver metastasis and had undergone surgery and chemotherapy. At the time of diagnosis, rectal cancer was stage IV (TNM classification of malignant tumors; T3N2M1), grade 3, and was revealed to be adenocarcinoma during histopathology. Liver metastasis affected segments 3 and 6. He underwent low anterior resection of the rectum and resection of the affected liver segments. He then underwent chemotherapy using fluorouracil that was arterially infused through a catheter inserted into the femoral artery and implanted into the hepatic artery through the celiac artery. He initially had good response to treatment but 2 years after diagnosis, he had a recurrence of liver metastasis. He underwent partial resection of segment 6 of the liver and was followed by chemotherapy using FOLFOX6 + bevacizumab protocol instead of arterial infusion. After finishing chemotherapy, he achieved complete remission 11 years after initial diagnosis. As a result of the possibility of another recurrence, the catheter remained in place without being replaced. His other past medical history was hypertension and he remained on amlodipine 5 mg daily and imidapril 5 mg daily. Social history revealed that he had smoked approximately 10 cigarettes a day for 50 years and drank alcohol occasionally. Family and environmental history was unremarkable. His employment history was an office worker, but he retired at the age of 60 and has not worked since then."}
{"note": "A 77-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with atypical symptoms. She had dyspnea when she lay on her back or in supine position. Also, she complained of the symptoms of superior vena cava syndrome in the mornings but in hours her symptoms were relieved. The symptoms and signs of superior vena cava syndrome in this case were intermittent cough and dysphagia, facial and neck swelling, bilateral jugular venous distention and collateral venous circulation. In her medical history, there was no history of previous surgical intervention and she only had the existing diagnosis of hypertension. Physical examination demonstrated a slight decrease in breath sounds over the right hemithorax. Chest radiography showed widened mediastinum, increased cardiothoracic ratio, deviation of the trachea, and convexity of the right superior mediastinum ( and ). A contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the existence of ascending aortic aneurysm which compressed the superior vena cava, and its maximum diameter was 14 cm (). It was decided that a prompt open surgical repair of this giant AAA was the most appropriate treatment option, due to the existence of high risk of rupture of aneurysm, hemorrhagic shock and death. After informing about the operation and obtaining the informed surgical consent form from the patient, she was transferred to the operating room and operated on in supine position under general anesthesia. Right common femoral vessels were exposed and cannulated in order to establish cardiopulmonary bypass, and then a median sternotomy was performed. A giant AAA was occupying most of the space in the pericardial cavity (). The aorta was cross clamped across the aortic arch. Under normothermic condition, an aortotomy was made and we used selective cardioplegia directly into both coronary ostia. Afterwards, the ascending aorta was excised (), and the aneurysm was replaced with a size 32 mm Dacron polyester fabric graft as supracoronary by using 3-0 prolene sutures supported by teﬂon strips, without performing any aortic valve and coronary artery procedures ().

{"note": "A 17 year old girl from India, Asia presented with a swelling in the right cheek of five months duration. She first noticed the swelling while washing her face. Swelling gradually increased in size, becoming more pronounced during mastication and while waking up in morning. Over the last one month she developed pain over the swelling. She gave no history of trauma or oral contraceptive pill usage. On physical examination there was a swelling in the region of the right parotid measuring 3 x 2 cm which was non-tender. Swelling was 3 cm in front of the tragus and 2 cm below the zygoma. There was no compressibility and the overlying skin was normal. On clenching the masseter the swelling diminished in size. There was no facial nerve involvement and parotid duct orifice was normal.\nFNAC revealed greenish color aspirate, cytology of which did not reveal any cellular material, this probably was extravasated blood and the greenish tinge, due to breakdown products of hemoglobin. This was evident as areas of hemorrhage on histology. A contrast CT was done () which showed a well defined heterogenous mass lesion involving the right masseter muscle which was highly vascular and a diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma was made. Preauricular skin incision was made as for a parotidectomy. Skin flaps were raised A normal looking parotid was found and the underlying masseter showed a diffuse bulge with no surface abnormality. The facial nerve trunk was identified and a superficial parotidectomy was done after carefully identifying and preserving the branches of the facial nerve. The facial nerve was seen spread over the diffuse bulge involving the masseter muscle (). The nerve fibres were subsequently dissected from its masseteric bed and gently raised with a hook. There was no definite encapsulated lesion or a palpable swelling which could be excised. The whole masseter exhibited compressibility with gradual filling. The facial nerve branches were gently lifted with a wooden spatula and under this arch the masseter was mobilized from the mandible and also severing"}
{"note": "A 62-year-old man was admitted to hospital with urinary infection 1 week after a surgical intervention for nephrolithiasis. He received ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day. Four days after the first intake of the antibiotic therapy, the patient started to present severe numbness in the feet gradually ascending towards the calves and sensory disturbances in the hands, but not flaccid paresis. During the examination of the patient, he had full strength in his extremities and only vibratory sensory distal deficit. Patellar and Achilles reflexes were absent. Cranial nerves were not involved, and no ataxic or autonomic features were reported. An electrodiagnostic test performed in the fourth week revealed that the peroneal and tibial nerves, as well as the sensory nerves in the lower limbs, were not excitable. In the upper limbs, the amplitudes of the compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) of the median and ulnar nerves were extremely low, less than 80% of the lower normal limit of motor amplitude, indicating axonal degeneration []. The sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity was severely diminished with temporal dispersion, especially at common entrapment sites, but no conduction blocks were registered (Table ). Distal CMAP latencies in the median and ulnar nerves were prolonged as electrophysiological evidence of demyelination features []. The H reflex recorded from the soleus muscle after the stimulation of the tibial nerve was bilaterally abolished. The electromyography revealed active denervation with increased temporal recruitment in the distal part of the lower limbs with no neurogenic pattern in the proximal muscles. One month later, it was discovered that the same clinical phenotype with lack of tendon reflexes was present in the lower limbs. The electrodiagnostic test reported more than 50% reduction of normal values of the sensory amplitudes in the median and ulnar nerves and inexcitability of the sural nerve (Table ). In our case, the involvement of the upper limbs was also prominent, even if the length-dependent pattern was respected. The fibular and tibial nerves became electrically excitable late in the disorder, but the"}
{"note": "A 40-year-old male patient was admitted to the Department of Urology, Calcutta National Medical College, with a complaint of clear fluid discharge from an intra-abdominal drain placed on the right side of his lower abdomen. He had a history of an open appendicectomy done at a primary health care center 3 weeks previously for clinically suspected acute appendicitis. According to the operating surgeon's brief, there was a mass in the right iliac fossa. The appendix was inflamed and was densely adhered to the mass. The surgeon was able to dissect out the appendix with difficulty. During the dissection, the mass sustained an injury that resulted in clear discharge through it. The surgeon suspected a ureteral injury but was unable to repair it; hence, he inserted a drain and referred the patient to us for further management.\nOn examination, the patient was anxious but his clinical parameters, hemogram, renal function tests, and serum biochemistry were normal. The patient had no significant medical or surgical history apart from the present episode. There was an output of approximately 500 to 600 mL per day from the abdominal drain. Analysis of the drain fluid revealed a high creatinine level, which suggested that the output was urine. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen could not delineate the left kidney. The right kidney and ureter were normal on the intravenous pyelogram (IVP) but the left kidney was not seen in its anatomical position. On careful examination of the IVP, a faint shadow with areas of contrast excretion could be seen on the right side, especially in late films at the level of the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae (). Considering the possibility of crossed renal ectopia, contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis (). The ectopic left kidney was small and showed excretion of contrast with evidence of hydronephrosis. The two renal units were not fused with each other. Cystoscopy revealed a normally placed left ureteric orifice. A retrograde pyelogram (RGP) on the left side showed a hydr"}
{"note": "An 8 year-old girl with a past medical history of constipation presented with a history of vomiting for nine months. The vomiting was intermittent, non-bloody, at times bilious, and occasionally contained food particles. An abdominal ultrasound was performed which demonstrated debris within a dilated proximal duodenum. The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and superior mesenteric vein (SMV) were visualized with the SMA lying to the left of the SMV with normal anatomic alignment []. No large solid or cystic masses were seen.\nA standard barium single contrast upper gastrointestinal (UGI) series was performed with the contrast entering the antrum and duodenal bulb. The proximal duodenum and descending duodenum were markedly dilated in caliber with apparent tapering of the third part of the duodenum. There was an abrupt cutoff with no contrast extending beyond approximately the mid abdomen []. Delayed images were obtained while the patient was supine with contrast never extending beyond the third portion of the duodenum [].\nPatient was subsequently placed prone for several minutes with eventual slight transit of contrast []. Thirty minute delayed prone images demonstrated contrast in the proximal small bowel, however proximal duodenum remained markedly dilated and contrast/debris filled []. Additionally delayed overhead images demonstrated contrast extending to the distal small bowel after patient had been upright for greater than 30 minutes []. Markedly dilated proximal duodenum with abrupt cutoff in the third portion of the duodenum raised concern for a questionable mass like positionally dependent extrinsic compression of the third portion of the duodenum.\nA subsequent computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was performed with oral and intravenous contrast. The duodenum was distended with the third part of the duodenum tented downward []. The duodenal/jejunal junction was severely narrowed and coursed distally anterior to the right common femoral artery below the bifurcation [].\nThe patient was taken for an exploratory laparotomy and found to have dense vascularized bands without intestinal malrotation. Upon entering the abdomen, the cecum was noted to be in normal anatomical position. Further exploration"}

The mother gave a history of hospitalization for fever and pain in the right upper limb at 6 months of age. There was no history of trauma or surgery on the shoulder joint. The child had adapted to carry out the daily chores with her left hand. She had stopped schooling, as her writing speed and clarity with her left hand was impaired. Activities of personal hygiene were managed well.\nA thorough examination ruled out congenital deformity. There was a scar along the posterior axillary fold healed with secondary intention. The affected humerus was shortened by 16 cm (right humerus measured 8 cm, left 24 cm) without angular deformities. The shoulder was dislocated with the head situated inferior and posterior to the glenoid cavity rotating the entire extremity through almost 180°. The palm facing posteriorly and the olecranon anteriorly. Attempts to position the arm across the chest actively exaggerated the deformity [].\nThe humeral head was enlarged but easily reducible. This significantly improved the disability by placing the hand in front of the chest. The elbow joint and the hand were normal with wasting of upper limb. There was no neurovascular abnormality.\nPlain roentgenograms showed a dislocated glenohumeral joint with enlarged humeral head and a small dysplastic glenoid fossa. The humeral shaft was short and thin, condyles were dysplastic, but the elbow joint was normal. There were no angular deformities.\nA clinicoradiological correlation revealed two components of the deformity, instability as major cause of functional impairment and humeral shortening that led to the cosmetic deformity.\nWe decided to correct the deformity by combining shoulder arthrodesis with humeral lengthening as a single-stage procedure. The obstacles were dysplasia of the shoulder that decreased the area of contact at the glenohumeral joint, small girth of the humeral shaft, quality of bone, type of fixation, and the soft tissue constraints during lengthening. We formulated the following surgical plan. The patient was kept"}

There was tachycardia with normal blood pressure (BP). The surgeon on abdominal examination found to have a vague epigastric mass associated with tenderness. Then the patient underwent ultrasonography of the abdomen and suspected to have the possibility of internal bleeding within pseudocyst of the pancreas, occupying whole of the lesser sac. Then patient was referred to us for further management.\nThere was severe pain in the abdomen with tachycardia and BP was 100/60 mm of Hg. As other routine blood investigations were within normal limits, patient was subjected to CT scan of the abdomen, which revealed a well-demarcated mass of size 10 cm × 13 cm arising from the body of pancreas, which was composed of a solid-cystic portion with enhancement of contrast in solid portions and occupying the whole of the lesser sac, posteriorly abutting to the splenic vessels with a breach in the anterolateral part of the capsule (rupture) of tumor with minimal hemoperitoneum. The distal tail of pancreas could not be made out. The impression was SPT arising from the body of pancreas without any metastasis to the liver.\nThen it was planned for surgical excision of the mass along with possible splenectomy. An informed consent was taken for the same. The roof top incision was taken. On the exploration, there was a significantly large tumor mass arising from the body of the pancreas, extending to the left subhepatic region, displacing the gastrohepatic ligament anteriorly. The tumor was abutting the transverse mesocolon. There were no metastatic lesions on the surface of the liver. There was minimal hemoperitoneum, which may be due to rupture of the tumor. With meticulous dissection whole mass was removed along with a tail of pancreas. The dissection to separate splenic vessels from tumor and tail of pancreas was possible; in view of low malignant potential"}
{"note": "An active 67-year-old male presented with recent onset of impaired effort tolerance, dyspnoea, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. His previous medical history included an oesophagectomy and left upper lobectomy via left thoracotomy for oesophageal cancer 6 years prior to this presentation. Post oesophagectomy, a surveillance gastroscopy was done with successful dilation of a stricture. There was no history of severe reflux or excessive symptoms of gastrointestinal inflammation. The patient was a retired cardiologist from the same institution, and he gave full consent for his case to be reported.\nCardiac examination and transthoracic echocardiography diagnosed severe mitral valve regurgitation (MR) because of prolapse of his posterior mitral valve leaflet. A mutual cardiology and surgical decision was made to proceed with a minimally invasive mitral valve repair procedure via right-side minithoracotomy, performed by a surgeon experienced in this technique.\nThere was a strong team feeling that the patient would benefit from an intraoperative TOE to guide surgical management and intraoperatively confirm a successful procedure. Careful and critical consideration was given to the risks and benefits of TOE probe placement and manipulation in this patient in light of his previous surgical history. All surgical discussions included the thoracic surgeon who performed this patient’s lobectomy and oesophagectomy procedures. Opinion was that because the oesophagus was removed and part of the stomach, with its larger lumen, was in the patient’s thorax this would simplify TOE probe placement and make it atraumatic. A gastroscopy was not performed prior to surgery although it is acknowledged that this may have guided the risk of TOE placement. The patient and his close relatives were well informed of all risks and were included in discussions throughout the surgical planning stages. Informed written consent for surgery, anaesthesia and TOE was obtained. While epicardial echocardiography may have been helpful with the intraoperative management, the surgical and anaesthetic teams both felt that the images from epicardial echocardiography would not have been able to provide the same degree of continuous detail that was obtainable through the use of TOE"}

The pain was fluctuating in severity, did not correlate with specific activities, and was only partially relieved with common analgesics. The patient's work involved prolonged standing and heavy lifting. He had had bilateral pes planus and valgus heels during his childhood but had been asymptomatic for several years. Two abdominal nodules had been excised by a dermatologist two years prior to the onset of his presenting complaint. The histopathology report confirmed they were a fibroma and a leiomyoma of no particular clinical significance. Apart from a few other minor injuries, his past medical and surgical history was otherwise unremarkable.\nThe pain was attributed to the patient's previous pes planus deformity and was treated conservatively with common analgesia by the GP. Over the next three months the pain did not resolve and the patient was referred to the local orthopedics outpatient clinic. Extensive X-ray studies and blood tests including inflammatory and immunological markers were all normal, and the patient was referred to Orthotics for foot arch support.\nDespite the arch support, the pain progressively worsened over the next 6 months. A foot MRI revealed mild, early degenerative 1st MTP joint changes with a small amount of fusion, but no other abnormalities. The diagnosis of reflex sympathetic dystrophy was also considered and supported by the findings of a radionuclide isotope scan. Although rocker soles and stronger analgesia (including oral morphine) were suggested, these failed to control the symptoms. Although this was followed by physiotherapy and multiple guanethidine blocks, symptoms remained uncontrolled and caused significant disability 18 months after the patient's first GP visit.\nIn the following weeks the patient developed progressive weight loss, fatigue, and muscle wasting below the knee. He noticed for the first time a firm round mass (approximately 15 cm) on the lower aspect of the posterior thigh. He was referred back to"}

He ultimately underwent a Bentall procedure at 12 years of age. Upon routine cardiology clinic follow-up an incidental finding of a cystic structure in the liver was noted during echocardiography ().\nHe was asymptomatic from a cardiac and gastrointestinal standpoint. The remainder of his echocardiogram showed normal mechanical aortic valve function and normal left ventricular function. His pacemaker function was normal.\nAn abdominal CT was obtained to further characterize the lesion. Compared to a CT obtained 4years previously a new, well demarcated, heterogenously enhancing mass or aneurysm was identified between the lesser curvature of the stomach and the liver measuring 3.9 cm × 5.3 cm × 4.3 cm ( and ). A small branch off the left gastric artery appeared to enter the left anterior aspect of the mass ().\nAn abdominal ultrasound with Doppler performed after the CT scan was consistent with a patent aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm impressing upon the left hepatic lobe ( and ).

She reports no past medical history, and social history is notable for tobacco use. The patient stated that she first noticed a small, yellow, and fleshy bump on her right nipple approximately two years prior. She became concerned due to its rapid growth in the last year. Four months prior, she visited her primary care provider who performed a shave biopsy of the lesion. Initial pathology results suggested squamous cell carcinoma, but this was thought to be discordant with the clinical picture. At consultation, she reported that her right breast had also started feeling hot and tender for two weeks duration. On examination, her right breast was erythematous and rigid with a 2.2 cm lesion consuming the right nipple. Her nipple also drained yellow pus. The patient was placed on a course of antibiotics due to concerns for an abscess.\nAn MRI was ordered to investigate possible underlying breast malignancy. Results of the MRI showed no solid mass underlying the nipple. A wedge biopsy of the nipple was performed to confirm the initial shave biopsy pathology (). Pathology showed verrucous histologic features with chronic inflammation and underlying abscess with concerns for a possible cutaneous malignancy. Specifically, there was marked papillomatosis with hypergranulomatosis between the papillae as well as a lack of granules at the papillary surfaces. Immunohistochemical testing was also positive for HPV L1 capsid protein. Because the initial shave biopsy showed SCC with positive margins, this clinical picture suggested that an inadequate sample was taken during the wedge biopsy. After consultation of literature, excision with wide margins was determined to be appropriate for removal of the lesion.\nThe patient underwent a wide excision of the right nipple-areola complex for removal of the growth. A 6.2 cm x 3.2 cm skin ellipse was excised encompassing the 2.2 cm nipple lesion. On final histologic examination, the lesion was found to be a large tumor with ver"}

There was no respiratory discomfort or hemodynamic instability. A chest X-ray and abdominal X-ray done to look for perforation was normal. After the initial resuscitation, he was taken up for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy which revealed deep ulcers of esophagus at approximately 20 cm from the incisors and scattered superficial ulcers in the rest of the esophagus along with diffuse erythema. There were deep ulcers in the antrum of the stomach extending to the pylorus along with ulcers in the mid body on the posterior surface. Duodenum was normal.\nThe patient was managed conservatively and discharged after 10 days of hospitalization. Two months after discharge he presented with complaints of dysphagia and recurrent vomiting of brownish foul smelling liquid. An upper gastrointestinal examination revealed a tight stricture at 20 cm, which did not allow the endoscope (Pentax videoscope EG 3840) to go beyond. A barium swallow and meal follow through examination showed the presence of a 3 cm long stricture in the upper esophagus. The rest of the esophagus was normal. The stomach showed slight lack of distensibility with slight thickening of the folds in the fundus. There was very little flow of barium into the duodenum, but instead the transverse colon showed opacification along with descending colon, suggesting a possibility of gastro-colic fistula in the proximal body of the stomach from the greater curvature ().\nSubsequent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy of the stomach done after esophageal dilatation with Savary Gilliard dilators revealed severe antral and pyloric stenosis with scarring.

He was a patient with well controlled type II diabetic mellitus attending our clinic with above the knee amputation stump pain and could not wear his prosthesis for 3 weeks. The history report from rehabilitation department was that the patient experienced a blast injury on his left thigh and leg. He underwent above the knee amputation 28 years ago. Approximately 6 weeks after the surgery, the prosthesis was made for the patient and a rehabilitation at home program was started. Neuropathic stump pain was recorded 3 months thereafter. Stump neuroma and bone spur were suspected to be the pain origin. The patient underwent stump revision with excision of neuroma and bone spur. After the second operation, no evidence was found of stump complication, and the patient was admitted in the military ward with orthopedic trauma services. He had some degree of posttraumatic stress disorder countered with psychiatric team support. No suicidal or homicidal ideation while admitted was noted. Daily life activities and self-care ability were supported by a physiotherapist. The patient was discharged at every 2–3 weeks follow-up appointments for 2 months and every 3 months thereafter.

The lesion was said to have started as a small firm painless swelling in the left infra-orbital region, which gradually increased in size until 3 months later when it became ulcerated with associated pain and purulent discharge. Physical examination revealed a cachectic and pale elderly man with an obvious facial asymmetry due to a fleshy exophytic mass on the left side of the face. The patient was not a known diabetic or hypertensive and had no other known systemic disease. There was no history of tobacco or alcohol use and he was not being treated for any chronic condition. The mass measured about 16 cm in its widest diameter and extends from the left supra-orbital region to the left maxillary area and also to the left temporal area about 1 cm anterior to the left auricle. The mass caused a deviation of the lateral wall of the left nostril to the right, though clinically the nasal wall did not appear infiltrated by the tumor. It also extended superiorly such that the left eye globe could not be visualized [].\nThe exophytic mass had a necrotic central area which was covered with slough tissue. There was impaired mouth opening; the left buccal sulcus was fully obliterated by the tumor mass but the palate appeared clinically normal.\nFine needle aspiration cytology suggested a malignant epithelial neoplasm possibly a salivary gland malignancy or a skin adnexia malignant tumor. Following incisional biopsy, sections showed a malignant epithelial neoplasm composed of islands of large oval to polyhedral malignant squamous cells with eosinophilic to amphophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei with some of the nuclei peripherally placed.

After 3 days the patient consulted his general practitioner, where he received a local pain relief injection with a corticosteroid. Having no pain relief again and with a progressive symptomatology in the right leg accompanied by numbness, the patient was admitted to our hospital.\nAt admission the patient showed severe lumbar spine pain with radiation alongside the dermatome L5 on the right side till the first toe persisting for 6 days and suggesting a nucleus pulposus prolapse. Since 2 days the patient had a hypoesthesia in the same dermatome with a maximum in the lower leg and foot. The femoral nerve stretch test was positive on the right side and the straight leg raise test was early positive at 20° elevation of the right leg while these tests were negative on the left side. The Achilles tendon reflex and the patella tendon reflex could be provoked on both sides similarly. There was no motoric deficit in both legs, no bladder or bowel dysfunction, and no saddle anesthesia. Importantly, the skin had no abnormal findings. The medical history was unremarkable except of arterial hypertension and a nucleotomy of a cervical disc. For ambulant non-controllable pain the patient was admitted to our hospital.

At the time of admission, she had completely lost occupational capacity of her left upper limb. Multiple foul smelling ulcers had developed over the swelling. Physical examination revealed a solid mass over proximal part of left upper limb measuring 450mm × 250mm with loss of normal contour of the left shoulder. Two discharging ulcers and a huge necrotic ulcer with slough were seen at the posterolateral and posterior surfaces respectively of the left arm. The swelling was bony hard in consistency but not tender on palpation. Dilated veins were noted on its surface. No lymph nodes were palpable over cervical and axillary regions. Computed tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were unable to be performed on admission due to its enormous size of swelling. Hence angiography of the left upper limb was performed to locate the anatomical position of major vessels and to detect anomalies as well. Trucut biopsy of the mass was performed and the histopathological examination showed fragments of tumour tissue composed of predominantly cartilaginous tissue with nuclei which were plump and hyperchromatic with occasional two nuclei per lacuna, which is consistent with well differentiated chondrosarcoma.\nAn informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the operation. A multi-disciplinary intervention by the orthopaedic, radiological, anaesthetist and oncology team was adopted. She underwent forequarter amputation of her left upper limb. The tumour tissues were excised with maximum possible surgical safety margins. Intraoperatively there was neither excessive bleeding nor development of major complications. The resected mass measured 450 × 415 × 250mm and weighed 31kg () and was submitted for histopathological examination. It was reported as a well differentiated chondrosarcoma.

The medical history of the boy included a mild pulmonary valve stenosis and a secundum atrial septal defect with a left-right shunt. He showed a good physical and cardiac fitness and a normal nutritional status. The family history was positive for maxillofacial anomalies: the boy's older sister had been previously diagnosed with a dysplastic fibroma, a rare benign fibrovascular defect in the mandible, and a resection of the affected area in the mandible had been performed. His father and paternal grandmother had a positive history of odontogenic cysts as well as basal cell carcinomas, although the family history of OKCs was negative. The radiological examination showed three suspicious hypomineralisations visible as radiolucencies in the panoramic radiograph associated with the retained teeth 13 and 23 and the ectopic tooth 27 (). The young patient was referred to the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery for a surgical examination of the radiologic anomalies.\nThe operation was performed under general anesthesia. The suspected pathological area around teeth 23 and 13 showed no visible intraoperative pathological signs. A bone and soft tissue biopsy for histological examination was taken. In the area of tooth 27, a well-marked membrane was revealed, filled with a viscid fluid and fully enclosing the dental crown. The clinical aspect was consistent with a follicular cyst. During the radical cystectomy, tooth 27 was removed due to massive attachment loss. The histopathological biopsy showed a fibroosseous lesion in the area of teeth 13 and 23.

Postoperatively, he had developed abscesses on the upper medial aspect of his left thigh in the second month and on the lateral aspect of the left gluteal region in the third month. All these abscesses had been treated by surgical drainage and with antibiotics. Three years after the hip operation, he had developed a perianal abscess which was also drained. However, the intermittent spontaneous purulent discharge in the perianal region continued for 13 years since the patient did not seek any medical care during this period. His past medical history was not conclusive for any inflammatory bowel disease. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in a different medical center eight months prior to his admission demonstrated an abscess cavity, measuring 2 cm in diameter, located superior to the levator ani muscle and its tract of 10 cm coursing from its internal opening in the rectum down to the perianal region (). The laboratory analysis including complete blood count, blood biochemistry, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were within normal limits. Physical examination revealed the presence of two external openings 7 cm and 3 cm from the anal verge at the 3 o'clock and 2 o'clock positions, respectively. The results of digital rectal examination and colonoscopy were normal and the internal opening of the tract was not visualized. Based on these clinical findings, surgical intervention for the complex fistula in ano was planned. After bowel preparation, the patient was taken to the operation room. Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a jack-knife position and the buttocks were taped apart. The fistula tracts were laid open to the level of the anal sphincters. At this level, digital examination was performed"}

There was no dysphagia, no neck mass, and no weight loss or loss of appetite. Other ear, nose, and throat (ENT) history was unremarkable.\nOn oral cavity examination, there was a left hard palate lesion of approximately 2 × 2 cm that appeared ulcerative and bled easily. Other ENT examination results were normal. The patient underwent left incisional biopsy of the hard palate mass, which suggested adenoid cystic carcinoma, and computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed no metastases.\nThe patient was scheduled for left inferior maxillectomy and the insertion of a prosthesis, and the final histopathology results confirmed the diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma. Postoperatively, the patient received radiotherapy of 66 GY per 33 fractions. No postoperative radiological imaging was found for this patient because the procedure and treatment were performed outside the hospital.\nThe patient again presented at our ENT clinic in May 2011 with a tongue lesion on the right side, as shown in Figure , which she had been aware of for approximately one month without any history of dysphagia, dyspnea, or neck mass. On physical examination, the patient looked cachectic and depressed. Tongue examination revealed a tongue mass on the right side measuring 2 × 1 cm and involving the base of the tongue but not crossing the midline, which was hard on palpitation. Neck examination revealed no remarkable findings and other ENT examinations were normal. CT scanning of the neck revealed an exophytic tongue mass of approximately 2 × 2 cm on the right side.

She also presented with a pressure ulcer associated with the right calcaneal osteomyelitis due to being bedridden for a prolonged period. This was treated with debridement, tenotomy of the calcaneus tendon, and antibiotic therapy in the unit of origin. The culture result showed polymicrobial growth. She was discharged for outpatient follow-up and oral antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. The infection persisted without ulcer healing, and after 14 months of follow-up, she was referred to the Foot and Ankle Surgery Service of Santo Antônio Hospital and was admitted in March 2016. In the initial evaluation, the patient used a wheelchair for mobility due to a posterior calcaneal ulcer with purulent secretion and exposure of necrotic bone tissue ().

Clinical examination revealed a discontinuity of the lower border of the mandible on the left side. Her mouth opening was restricted to 10 mm and the mandible was seen to deviate to the left side on opening. Intra oral examination revealed a derangement of occlusion. There was no mobility of the fractured segments. A hematoma was present on the buccal aspect in the parasymphyseal region on the right side []. Further, the orthopantomograph confirmed our clinical observations []. A diagnosis of fracture of the body of the mandible on the left side associated with a fracture of the parasymphysis on the right side of the mandible was made.\nThe treatment approach chosen was a unique one, involving a modification of the conventional transosseous wiring technique. The procedure was carried out under general anesthesia. The body fracture was exposed using a buccal vestibular incision. Two holes were drilled on either side of the fracture line into the buccal cortical plate; one at the region of external oblique ridge to avoid damage to the permanent tooth germ of the first molar and the other close to the lower border of the mandible. Two intermaxillary fixation (IMF) screws with eyelets, 1.5 mm diameter and 10 mm in length were inserted into the holes such that they were perpendicular to the cortical plate following which a 26 gauge stainless steel wire was passed into the eyelets and fastened. Having assuring reduction and fixation of the fractured ends, wound closure was achieved. Fracture reduction and stabilization was concluded satisfactory as shown by the post-operative occlusion. Recovery from general anesthesia was uneventful. An orthopantomograph was made post-operatively to confirm the approximation of the fractured ends [].

She was diagnosed with SLE and was started on prednisolone and hydroxychloroquine. A Doppler examination of limbs was performed with contrast injected intravenously through the left internal jugular vein to prevent venous contamination in limbs since all limbs were affected and were to be evaluated. CT angiography of upper limbs revealed attenuation of bilateral radial and ulnar arteries with poor distal run off seen in left radial artery and in left ulnar artery run off till hand was seen. No thrombus was seen. In the lower limbs, bilateral arteries below the knees were attenuated. Right anterior tibial artery and right peroneal artery were attenuated and left posterior tibial artery was totally obliterated [].

The medical history of the boy included a mild pulmonary valve stenosis and a secundum atrial septal defect with a left-right shunt. He showed a good physical and cardiac fitness and a normal nutritional status. The family history was positive for maxillofacial anomalies: the boy's older sister had been previously diagnosed with a dysplastic fibroma, a rare benign fibrovascular defect in the mandible, and a resection of the affected area in the mandible had been performed. His father and paternal grandmother had a positive history of odontogenic cysts as well as basal cell carcinomas, although the family history of OKCs was negative. The radiological examination showed three suspicious hypomineralisations visible as radiolucencies in the panoramic radiograph associated with the retained teeth 13 and 23 and the ectopic tooth 27 (). The young patient was referred to the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery for a surgical examination of the radiologic anomalies.\nThe operation was performed under general anesthesia. The suspected pathological area around teeth 23 and 13 showed no visible intraoperative pathological signs. A bone and soft tissue biopsy for histological examination was taken. In the area of tooth 27, a well-marked membrane was revealed, filled with a viscid fluid and fully enclosing the dental crown. The clinical aspect was consistent with a follicular cyst. During the radical cystectomy, tooth 27 was removed due to massive attachment loss. The histopathological biopsy showed a fibroosseous lesion in the area of teeth 13 and 23.

She reports no past medical history, and social history is notable for tobacco use. The patient stated that she first noticed a small, yellow, and fleshy bump on her right nipple approximately two years prior. She became concerned due to its rapid growth in the last year. Four months prior, she visited her primary care provider who performed a shave biopsy of the lesion. Initial pathology results suggested squamous cell carcinoma, but this was thought to be discordant with the clinical picture. At consultation, she reported that her right breast had also started feeling hot and tender for two weeks duration. On examination, her right breast was erythematous and rigid with a 2.2 cm lesion consuming the right nipple. Her nipple also drained yellow pus. The patient was placed on a course of antibiotics due to concerns for an abscess.\nAn MRI was ordered to investigate possible underlying breast malignancy. Results of the MRI showed no solid mass underlying the nipple. A wedge biopsy of the nipple was performed to confirm the initial shave biopsy pathology (). Pathology showed verrucous histologic features with chronic inflammation and underlying abscess with concerns for a possible cutaneous malignancy. Specifically, there was marked papillomatosis with hypergranulomatosis between the papillae as well as a lack of granules at the papillary surfaces. Immunohistochemical testing was also positive for HPV L1 capsid protein. Because the initial shave biopsy showed SCC with positive margins, this clinical picture suggested that an inadequate sample was taken during the wedge biopsy. After consultation of literature, excision with wide margins was determined to be appropriate for removal of the lesion.\nThe patient underwent a wide excision of the right nipple-areola complex for removal of the growth.

The patient had an extraordinary medical record with no clear concluding diagnosis. In August 2005 the patient had laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to symptomatic cholecystitis. The surgery was not performed in our hospital. The postoperative course was reported as uncomplicated and the patient was discharged. However, 3 years later, in 2008, the patient complained about consistent, sharp, abdominal pain which was not accompanied by fever, nausea or vomiting. Improper food intake was also ruled out as a potential source of consistent abdominal pain. The patient was subsequently hospitalized several times in gastroenterology wards with no clear diagnosis. It was suspected that symptoms were connected with diverticular disease, hemorrhoids or gastroenteritis. From March 2011 the patient additionally complained about consistent pain within the lower part of the rectum. In June 2011 the patient was again hospitalized and underwent computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis which, apart from diverticular disease, revealed chronic perianal abscesses which were diagnosed as a postinflammatory process after diverticulitis. Laboratory tests were within the normal range. Colonoscopy showed diverticular disease and a 2 mm polyp in the descending colon which was removed and sent for histopathologic examination, which revealed a tiny tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia with complete removal. After the hospitalization and the patient's discharge, symptoms were somewhat reduced, but not entirely alleviated.\nIn November 2011 symptoms again intensified and the diagnostic process needed to be repeated. Computed tomography was repeated and revealed diverticular sigmoid colon with numerous diverticula sized up to 18 mm as well as segmental, irregular thickening of the sigmoid wall and the rectum up to 9 mm.

He was found unconscious, by his relatives, bleeding from the oral cavity, and with a blood stained knife in his hand. He was urgently transferred to the hospital, where he received the appropriate resuscitation treatment. Examination of the oral cavity revealed extensive trauma to the soft and hard palate, without any other lesions to be seen in the head and neck region. Following stabilization of his condition the patient reported that he repeatedly stabbed his palate due to the intolerable character of the ongoing local pain, over the last few months, which he could not tolerate. He wanted to die from bleeding because he could not eat and he felt helpless. He preferred to die quickly using a knife instead of dying of thirst and hunger. Prior to the incident he had chronic limited mobility due to osteoarthritic problems and he spent most of the day confined to bed. Further history retrieved from the patient and his family revealed that over a period of approximately two months prior to the event the patient reported a painful oral cavity. He had a burning sensation in the tongue, and he was complaining of oral sensory discomfort, including dryness and taste alterations. The clinical symptomatology had led to a decrease in oral consumption of food and liquids, causing a significant weight loss of more than 10 kg during the last two months.

Thereafter weakness developed in both feet. He faced difficulty in performing daily activities like walking because he had to drag his feet as there was a presence of foot drop due to progressive weakness and he faced difficulty in holding slippers while walking. After a couple of months, he developed a similar type of weakness in both hands and therefore holding and grasping became difficult. As the severity was progressive, it started affecting his normal mobility components like standing balance, walking, overhead activities, holding various objects and fine skill movements. With the passage of time, he started losing sensations and because of this he developed an open wound at the ball of the great toe. He was referred to a private neurologist and underwent nerve biopsy as advised. The results showed axonopathy and but there was no evidence of inflammation.

The urinary tract anomaly was first revealed in the 26th week of pregnancy with bilateral hydronephrosis and possible posterior urethral valve in prenatal ultrasound. The delivery was uncomplicated with a birth weight of 3860 g and an Apgar score of 10. During the neonatal period, a voiding cystourethrography was performed and ruled out a posterior urethral valve as well as vesicoureteral reflux. Dynamic renal scintigraphy showed significant loss of the left kidney function and impaired urinary outflow from the right kidney with dilatation of the urinary tract. Due to significant hydronephrosis and residual left kidney function, the consulting urologist qualified the patient for a left side nephrectomy, which was performed without complications. A progression in the chronic kidney disease was observed with recurrent urinary tract infections during infancy. At the age of 11 months, the child was qualified for a Sober ureterostomy due to persistent right side ureterohydronephrosis. The procedure had to be performed twice, at 1-month interval, because of an early stomal stenosis. The mother of the patient maintained proper care of the ureterostomy, with daily use of urostomy bags and sealing paste, and no further complications were observed for several years.

An endobronchial ultrasound with biopsy of the mass was performed, which showed benign bronchial epithelial cells. Since endobronchial resection of the mass would lead to a large defect in the right bronchus intermedius, the decision was made to perform robotic-assisted resection of the lesion (Video ).\nWe used the Da Vinci Xi robot to perform resection of the endobronchial lesion and hilar mass with right lower lobe superior segmentectomy to remove the lesion. The patient had a “five on a dice” port placement for the operation [, ]. First, we performed the right lower lobe superior segmentectomy to obtain adequate exposure of the hilar mass. We mobilized the superior segmental branch of pulmonary artery and superior segmental branch of the right lower lobe going to the inferior pulmonary vein and divided them with the vascular robot stapler. We divided the superior segmental branch of right lower lobe bronchus with the robot blue load stapler. We used indocyanine green angiography to define the borders of the superior segment of the right lower lobe, which was divided using the robot blue load stapler.

After 1 month’s usage, a brush should be replaced. However, the patient went against the medical advice and used the brush vigorously several times a day to clean tracheal mucous secretions. As a result, he had mislaid voice prosthesis brushes numerous times in his bronchi or carina, which had to be removed by bronchoscopy.\nOn examination, the patient had no obvious abnormality in the valve puncture. The stoma site was normal except for some crusting around the edges. A marked abnormality on the tracheal wall ~6 cm inferior to the stoma site was revealed, through a flexible nasal endoscopic examination. The abnormality was later confirmed to be a TOF. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan to delineate the surrounding anatomy as to facilitate the planning of the surgery (–).\nInitially, direct suturing under endoscopic guidance was attempted, which was initially successful but within a day the suture line had been disrupted by use of the brush. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was inserted for nutritional support. One option was to perform a right thoracotomy to disconnect the TOF and interposition an intercostal muscle flap between the oesophagus and trachea. However, due to the patient’"}

The patient reported having consulted with the maxillofacial surgery service in another city because of a slight increase in the volume in the left zygomatic region, which caused intermittent, intense and lacerating pain that irradiated to the ipsilateral temporal region with an intensity of eight on the visual analog scale and which was not relieved with common analgesics [Figures and ]. That service undertook an incisional biopsy with an intraoral approach and diagnosed an odontogenic myxoma. After a physical examination of the patient, a slight increase in volume with diffuse borders and a firm consistency was detected.\nComputer tomography (CT) was requested, revealing a lesion of 3 cm × 3 cm with clear boundaries and mixed density, which was compromising the body of the left malar bone and was spreading to the zygomatic arch [Figures -].\nAccording to the patient's clinical history, the imaging and biopsy diagnosis a tumor resection was planned with a safety margin appropriate to the initial diagnosis, accessing the lesion with a coronal approach. The tumor was resected with a reciprocating saw, leaving macroscopic margins in the healthy bone [Figures and ]. The facial architecture was reconstructed in the same surgical event, using a 2.0 mm titanium osteosynthesis plate to restore the facial arch that had been lost, in addition to a biocompatible porous high-density polyethylene alloplastic graft to restore the contour [Figures and ].\nA surgical specimen of 3 cm × 4 cm was obtained, mainly consisting of intact bone with some areas where the lesion had been exteriorized to the cortical bone.

An elevated polyp was removed in one-piece by endoscopic submucosal dissection. The patient received a repeat endoscopy at one and two year and no remnant lesion was noted.\nA 63 year-old man presented with indigestion and abdominal discomfort. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a 0.5 cm sized elevated nodule in the lesser curvature of the antrum. The lesion was biopsied initially and endoscopioc submucosal dissection was done. The patient repeated upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at one and two year and no residual lesion was seen.\n. A 52 year-old man was found out to have a 1.5 cm sized polyp in the lower body of the stomach during staging work up for rectal cancer. The patient underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection and the lesion was completely removed. The resected segment of rectum revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma and a incidentally found, separately located 0.6 cm sized NET. He received a repeat upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy at two year without any evidence of recurrence.\n. A 65 year-old man with no family hstory of multiple endocrine neoplasia presented with chronic dyspepsia. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and computed tomography scan revealed a 5 cm sized gastric mass in the lesser curvature aspect of the body. Initial endoscopic biopsy diagnosis at the local clinic was well differentiated adenocarcinoma. He underwent a subtotal gastrectomy and was found to have a 5.5 cm tubulovillous adenoma. Unexpectedly, small nests of tumor cells forming a mass infiltrated into the submucosa with an invasion depth of 800 μm. All sixty regional lymph nodes procured from the resected specimen were free of tumor.

{"note": "A 75-year-old woman received medical care, complaining of intermittent pain in the right hypochondrium. Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a few small gallbladder stones with gallbladder wall thickening. Twenty-three years ago, this patient had undergone a median laparotomy to treat generalized peritonitis due to a perforated duodenal peptic ulcer. No other previous significant disease was reported and she was in good health.\nThe patient underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy without apparent complications. The first trocar, through the umbilical port, was introduced under direct vision due to the possibility of abdominal adhesions surrounding this site, which were confirmed during the surgical procedure. However, these adhesions did not impair the cholecystectomy.\nFour hours after the surgical procedure, the patient complained of increasing left lower quadrant pain and local abdominal distension was observed. Two hours later, enteric fluid leaked through the umbilical port scar, which became inflamed. The evidence of small bowel fistula indicated an immediate new surgical approach. Therefore, the patient began to receive two grams of ceftriaxone, followed by 1 g of IV twice a day.\nThe laparoscope was introduced through the umbilical port. The right side abdomen presented no abnormality and the cholecystectomy site continued to show a satisfactory appearance. The enteric leakage began to flow from the lower left abdominal flank, but a wide, left abdominal blockage by adhesions, due to the previous laparotomy, prevented a safe laparoscopic approach. A subsequent exploratory laparotomy through a paraumbilical median incision demonstrated a 0.6 cm focal perforation of the middle jejunum in the left flank, about 10 cm from the umbilical port. A peritoneal thin string adhesion was identified directly above this perforation. This adhesion most likely linked the peritoneal wall to the jejunum on the site of the perforation. During peritoneal insufflation, the distension of the abdominal wall broke the string and led to a jejunal perforation. Three stiches, using 4-0 silk thread closed the perforation [, ]. All abdominal fluid was aspirated and no abnormality was found at the cholecystectomy site or in any other part"}
{"note": "A 47-year-old female presented with a large foul smelling wound of the left inguinal region with severe pain with ambulation. She had been treated with radiation therapy for a locally aggressive urologic malignancy with not distant metastasis. A surgical plan that involved resection of the tumor, femoral artery, and vein with immediate reconstruction of the vessels and soft tissues was designed for this patient. The abdomen would not be a donor site given her ureterostomy on the right and tumor involvement of both the femoral arterial and venous bifurcations on the left.\nThe patient underwent resection of the tumor and immediate reconstruction of the femoral artery and vein with heparin-bonded PTFE grafts (Propaten, W.L. Gore, Inc., Flagstaff, AZ) []. Once flow had been established to the left lower extremity, the resulting soft tissue deficit was evaluated. An 8 cm × 15 cm soft tissue defect in the inguinal region had to be reconstructed. Given the fact that the patient had a history of deep venous thrombosis, resection of the gracilis with the tumor, and reconstruction of the femoral artery and vein from just below the iliac bifurcations to the midthigh we chose to use the anterolateral thigh flap from the opposite extremity. Other flaps such as the rectus abdominis and rectus femoris are other viable options. In this particular case the diep inferior epigastric vessels were part of the resection. The rectus femoris flap is also useful in reconstruction of groin defects. It can be used without the loss of knee extension. The anterolateral thigh is extremely versatile with multiple uses for lower extremity reconstruction [, ].\nThe flap was designed on the lateral thigh in order to obtain maximal pedicle length (). Skin signals were identified and marked. An exploration incision was made to identify the descending branch off the lateral circumflex femoral artery. The most distal perforators were located and marked on the surface of the skin paddle of the flap. Typical pedicle length for this flap is approximately 12 cm, depending on"}

The patient had a history of thyroid follicular adenocarcinoma which was treated surgically with total thyroidectomy and postoperative iodine treatment 25 years prior to presentation. At 12 years post thyroidectomy, she was diagnosed with a calcaneal mass of the same pathology and diagnosed with delayed distant thyroid carcinoma metastasis to the calcaneus. 10 years after calcaneal mass excision, the patient was diagnosed with a proximal tibial mass that turned out to be also delayed metastasis of the same pathology.\nAt the first presentation 15 years ago, she initially presented complaining of mild edema of the left ankle with intermittent pain upon daily activity. Physical exam showed full range of motion of the ankle joint with intact motor power and intact neurovascular status. There were no cutaneous lesions.\nPlain radiographs of the left ankle showed a 3-centimeter oval lytic lesion in the anterior aspect of the calcaneum ().\nAn MRI of the left ankle showed a 3.2 cm well-defined benign-looking lytic lesion of the calcaneal neck reaching the cortex which appeared to be mildly irregular with mild degenerative disease of the posterior subtalar joint consistent with an intraosseous ganglion cyst of the calcaneus ().\nMedical treatment with NSAIDs and paracetamol was initiated, along with partial weight bearing and relative rest with no improvement at follow-up at 4 weeks. Surgical intervention was decided due to the persistent pain. The cyst was resected with a margin of surrounding fibro-osseous tissue and the bone grafted. Histopathological evaluation revealed a metastatic carcinoma of the thyroid gland. Immunostaining showed that the cells expressed cytokeratin, cytokeratin 7, and thyroglobulin, all of which confirm the diagnosis ().\nFor further confirmation, the recently excised cyst slides were compared to the pathology slides of the thyroid excision undertaken 12 years prior to the calcaneal presentation and were found out to be of the same pathology ().\nThe patient had"}

He was a frail gentleman and suffered from severe COPD and peripheral vascular disease. He presented with a severely ischemic left forearm at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary, Wigan, UK. He previously had an axillo-femoral bypass for the affected upper limb which failed followed by a subclavian artery stent insertion which blocked subsequently. He was consented him for a left above elbow amputation by the vascular surgeons as his forearm ischemia was rapidly worsening. He had severe ischemic pain in his left forearm, which was controlled with a supraclavicular brachial plexus block the night before his operation.\nHis forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was measured as 1.6 liters and his echocardiogram showed moderate left ventricular dysfunction. General anesthesia deemed to carry a very high risk of cardio-pulmonary complications. Therefore, it was planned to perform this procedure under regional anesthesia as the sole anesthetic technique after obtaining patient’s consent. He was very restless due to the severe pain in his left hand and forearm and was not very cooperative.\nThe initial plan was to perform an axillary brachial plexus block to control his severe ischemic forearm pain but the axillary block could not be performed as he could not position his arm due to the severity of the pain. Therefore, the supraclavicular brachial plexus was technically easier to perform in this case and was performed using 20 mls of 0.375% bupivacaine under ultrasound guidance to control his pain and to perform surgery if the block proved adequate. The block was tested to cold and pinprick prior to the surgery but only provided adequate surgical anesthesia in the forearm up till the level of elbow, not above it.\nWe assumed that the block had been inadequate most probably due to technical difficulty to perform the block as the patient had not been able to"}

After the last episode both shoulders' range of motion was regressed and pain was elicited with movement. The patient visited a hospital at that point and without radiographic control performed, the diagnosis of bilateral shoulder contusions was posed. About three weeks later and as the patient realised that his injury was irreversible, he presented to the emergency room of our hospital. Clinical examination made clear that bilateral anterior shoulder dislocation was the point. (Fig. ). No neurovascular injury was diagnosed in any arm. At the time of examination the patient was able to perform flexion and abduction of both arms up to 60 degrees as well as almost full external rotation with no pain restraint. From the patient's history no previous incidence of shoulder dislocation was referred. Radiographic control and Computed Tomography Scanning revealed the dislocations as well as a sizeable greater tuberosity fracture of the left humerus and Hill Sachs lesion at both sides. (Fig. ).\nBilateral reductions under general anaesthesia and internal fixation of the left greater tuberosity fracture were performed (Fig. ). The reductions were easy to perform and shoulders' stabilisation was not carried out. No post manipulation neurovascular deficit was observed. Ultrasonography performed 4 days post surgery confirmed the integrity of rotator cuffs in both shoulders. Broad arm polyslings in abduction and internal rotation were used for 2 weeks and progressive mobilization started with pendulum exercises, forward flexion and abduction. A physiotherapy program of muscle enforcement was added at 3 weeks. The recovery was successful and after 2 months the patient had regained a normal range of motion in both shoulders with a minor lack at the last degrees of flexion and internal rotation of the left shoulder. Four months post-operatively the range of motion was fully recovered bilaterally and at the final follow-up, 2 years post surgery, the patient had not undergone any recurrent dislocation."}

At the local hospital, he was intubated and underwent immediate exploratory laparotomy where a splenectomy was performed. He also had a right tibia fracture that was treated with immobilisation. The cervical spine injury was detected while recovering from the laparotomy. His initial cervical radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were obtained after noticing right-sided weakness ( and ()). The family brought the child to our institution after his tibia fracture had healed. The neurological assessment at arrival revealed a Frankel grade D incomplete spinal cord injury. Right brown sequard hemiplegia was documented. There was more motor weakness in the right upper extremity, especially of the hand along with sensory loss in the left hand. A repeated MRI that was done under fiberoptic intubation with general anaesthesia on the way to the operating room showed improvement of the abnormal signal intensity and reduction of the impinging C4-5 disc ().\nWe did not perform skull traction as the CT scan did show at least partial healing of the dislocated facets (), and we started posteriorly because remodelled facets were felt to be restrictive to any anterior manipulation. Altering the natural facet articulation for the posterior release increases instability even after reduction and because of the small C4 lateral mass, we instrumented two vertebrae above and below the injured level.\nThe surgical procedure constituted three approaches, starting posteriorly for facets release, which did not result in reduction (), then anteriorly where we did a C5 corpectomy as well as discectomy of the adjacent discs. For the reduction, standard techniques were employed to realign the vertebrae. Despite the small size of the vertebrae, we were able to place divergent distraction pins and used them effectively ().

It was planned for composite resection followed by reconstruction with free fibula osteocutaneous flap. During the preoperative assessment, her dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulsations in both legs were normal by palpation. The left leg was selected and the fibula with a skin paddle of 22 × 9 cm was raised through standard anterior approach under tourniquet control. After the distal and proximal osteotomies and after ligating the distal end of the peroneal vessels and moving proximally, no septocutaneous perforators were noticed. Further dissection revealed a single musculo cutaneous perforator coming out of the soleus muscle and proceeding to the skin paddle. With the possibility of anomalous perforator in mind, the vessel was dissected along its entire length through the substance of the soleus muscle [] and was found to be originating from the posterior tibial artery 2 cm below the trifurcation. In order to be doubly sure about the contribution of this anomalous vessel to the skin paddle, we applied microvascular clamp to this vessel after releasing the tourniquet. To our surprise there was no bleeding from the margins of the skin paddle and bleeding was restored after the release of the clamp from the anomalous vessel confirming that this was the only vascular supply to the skin paddle. The rest of our flap dissection went normally and the flap was harvested as a single composite unit with two vascular pedicles [] and the donor site was closed partly with split-skin graft. After the necessary osteotomies were completed in the flap, the bone fixation was done and the intraoral inset of the flap was given.

On examination, the mass was small, mobile, firm, and nontender located in the soft tissue of left shoulder. The skin covering the mass was intact, and there was no ecchymosis and even erythema (). The shoulder range of motion had no functional impairment, and the patient was able to do the routine tasks with no neurovascular disturbance. Medically speaking, important clinical signs and symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and respiratory symptoms were not detected.\nThere was no visible fluctuation in this field, and it was estimated 0.5-1 cm in length and width. Tumor consistency was not similar to bone, and it seemed to be a soft tissue mass. The patient denied any history of trauma and also no significant family history was identified. Interestingly, the patient was operated by general surgeon 6 times because of relapses in a way the last one was 1.5 years ago. At the first time, the patient was referred to the outpatient clinic because of gradual mass enlargement.

She reports no past medical history, and social history is notable for tobacco use. The patient stated that she first noticed a small, yellow, and fleshy bump on her right nipple approximately two years prior. She became concerned due to its rapid growth in the last year. Four months prior, she visited her primary care provider who performed a shave biopsy of the lesion. Initial pathology results suggested squamous cell carcinoma, but this was thought to be discordant with the clinical picture. At consultation, she reported that her right breast had also started feeling hot and tender for two weeks duration. On examination, her right breast was erythematous and rigid with a 2.2 cm lesion consuming the right nipple. Her nipple also drained yellow pus. The patient was placed on a course of antibiotics due to concerns for an abscess.\nAn MRI was ordered to investigate possible underlying breast malignancy. Results of the MRI showed no solid mass underlying the nipple. A wedge biopsy of the nipple was performed to confirm the initial shave biopsy pathology (). Pathology showed verrucous histologic features with chronic inflammation and underlying abscess with concerns for a possible cutaneous malignancy. Specifically, there was marked papillomatosis with hypergranulomatosis between the papillae as well as a lack of granules at the papillary surfaces. Immunohistochemical testing was also positive for HPV L1 capsid protein. Because the initial shave biopsy showed SCC with positive margins, this clinical picture suggested that an inadequate sample was taken during the wedge biopsy. After consultation of literature, excision with wide margins was determined to be appropriate for removal of the lesion.\nThe patient underwent a wide excision of the right nipple-areola complex for removal of the growth.

On examination, he was conscious and oriented, hemodynamically stable, and unable to move his right lower limb which was externally rotated and shortened with a diffusely swollen upper thigh. He had tenderness over the right groin area with a palpable lump. Distal neurovascular examination was normal. Radiographic evaluation of pelvis and right thigh revealed right hip anterior dislocation with ipsilateral subtrochanteric femur fracture (). The patient was worked up for surgery immediately and emergency surgical intervention to reduce the hip was planned. After inducing anesthesia, no attempts of closed reduction using the various techniques to reduce the anterior dislocation were tried as the patient had an ipsilateral femur fracture because all the forces pass through the fracture site. Therefore, the patient was placed on a radiolucent table and with a help of image intensifier, under strict sterile precaution, initially, one 5mm Schanz pin was placed close to the intertrochanteric region and used as a joystick to reduce the head into the acetabulum but was unsuccessful; hence, another Schanz pin was placed parallelly and connected with each other using a pin to rod connector and then the rod along with the pins was used as an external reduction tool to reduce the right hip in a closed manner without the need of open reduction, thereby reducing the chances of vascular insult on the capsule.

The medical history of the boy included a mild pulmonary valve stenosis and a secundum atrial septal defect with a left-right shunt. He showed a good physical and cardiac fitness and a normal nutritional status. The family history was positive for maxillofacial anomalies: the boy's older sister had been previously diagnosed with a dysplastic fibroma, a rare benign fibrovascular defect in the mandible, and a resection of the affected area in the mandible had been performed. His father and paternal grandmother had a positive history of odontogenic cysts as well as basal cell carcinomas, although the family history of OKCs was negative. The radiological examination showed three suspicious hypomineralisations visible as radiolucencies in the panoramic radiograph associated with the retained teeth 13 and 23 and the ectopic tooth 27 (). The young patient was referred to the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery for a surgical examination of the radiologic anomalies.\nThe operation was performed under general anesthesia. The suspected pathological area around teeth 23 and 13 showed no visible intraoperative pathological signs. A bone and soft tissue biopsy for histological examination was taken. In the area of tooth 27, a well-marked membrane was revealed, filled with a viscid fluid and fully enclosing the dental crown. The clinical aspect was consistent with a follicular cyst. During the radical cystectomy, tooth 27 was removed due to massive attachment loss. The histopathological biopsy showed a fibroosseous lesion in the area of teeth 13 and 23.

Later on she had two surgeries of microsurgical mandibular reconstruction with the use of vascularized fibular bone autografts carried out in the regional clinical center. Unfortunately, the autotransplants were removed in both cases due to vascular anastomosis failure.\nIn May 2012, a reconstruction of the right mandible was done with a free nonvascularized rib autograft in our Department. Within a year after the surgery, the patient had retention of more than 90% of the autotransplant volume and the satisfactory function of mastication on the left side. However, no consolidation was observed and nonunions were diagnosed within the proximal and distal fixation areas that caused mobility and prevented any prosthetic treatment in the mandible on the right side. Therefore, reconstructive surgery with the resection of nonunions, bone grafting, and osteosynthesis was performed. Despite the surgical intervention, a control clinical and instrumental examination in 0.5 year after the operation detected slight mobility in the frontal region and within the right ramus and no radiological evidence of consolidation ().

The pain was not observed elsewhere on the body nor was it correlated with other symptoms, such as fever, nausea or vomiting. In addition, the pain did not affect food intake or daily physical activity. Before medical consultation no systematic treatment had been applied for the pain, which was relieved after some minutes, only to relapse some days later.\nHistory revealed an episode of reported angina 4 months prior to consultation, with non -specific ST/T abnormalities in the ECG. Physical examination revealed no important findings. The blood tests revealed no obvious pathology, with a normal hematocrit and blood coagulation parameters. Biochemical testing for hepatic and renal was also within normal values. Imaging included a chest radiography, which revealed no abnormalities and an abdominal CT scan with oral gastrografin intake, which revealed a 3 × 6 cm cystic formation located at the lower pole of the spleen (Figure ). Due to the lack of an infectious (no compatible clinical signs, no CRP or WBC count elevation, negative serological testing for Echinococcus) or traumatic background and the lack of evidence in favor of a cystic neoplasm (homologous content, normal perimeter, no increase in cancer-associated biochemical markers, such as Ca 19-9 and CEA), a latent congenital epithelial cyst was considered most probable. Four days later an MRI examination confirmed the previous result. The symptoms were not definitely associated to the cyst and the physician related them to the patient's increased stress, assuming she had irritable bowel syndrome.\nEight years later (2005), the patient visited her physician, reporting a periodic continuation of the abdominal pain, whereas neither the character nor the frequency of episodes differed.

After three months, another subcutaneous formation appeared, without changes in skin coverings, which grew in size and was slightly painful to effort. Another recurrence of the tumor for which the patient underwent surgical excision was at the age of 18 years and three months after.\nThe last recurrence was at 19 years old, when the clinical examination revealed the presence of postoperative local dehiscence upon which there was a soft tissue tumor, measuring 10 cm in large diameter. The patient accused local pain exacerbated by exercise, the increase in tumor size during exercise and paresthesia.\nThe plain X-ray revealed a nonspecific soft-tissue mass in the lower third of the upper right limb with calcification inside, without any changes in the adjacent bone structures ().\nThe MRI exam demonstrated round-oval heterogeneous signal tumor mass in the biceps brachial muscles, with high signal intensity on T2 weighted images and septa (). On T1 weighted images, the tumor had an intermediate signal with diffuse areas of fat increased signal (). On T2 fat-sat sequences, punctuate signal voids areas related to phleboliths can be seen (). The imaging features were specific for the recurrence of hemangioma, therefore gadolinium was not administered.\nA classic angiography was"}
{"note": "A 38-year-old right hand dominant male sustained an injury to his left shoulder girdle while riding a push bike to work at moderate speed. He was seen in the emergency department of a metropolitan hospital and referred to fracture clinic for further management of his injury.\nHe was seen in the specialist fracture clinic four days after his fracture was sustained. Examination revealed a closed injury to the left shoulder girdle and localized pain over the lateral aspect of his clavicle, with associated tenderness and crepitus. Initial radiographs revealed a displaced left distal clavicle fracture with no disruption to the coracoclavicular ligaments evident (). Radiographs also demonstrated mildly displaced fractures of the left third and fourth ribs posteriorly. Formal radiology reporting also concurred with the above findings.\nThe decision was made to proceed with surgical fixation of the fracture given its displaced and distal nature. He underwent operative fixation of the left distal clavicle fracture nine days after his original injury. A 6-hole hook plate was used to stabilise the fracture. Fracture reduction was confirmed on fluoroscopy and the position of the plate was also found to be in satisfactory position (). Gentle range of motion exercises were commenced in the immediate postoperative period. His wound was checked at two weeks postoperatively and postoperative radiographs displayed his fracture alignment and hardware position to be satisfactory.\nDespite his uneventful recovery from the operative fixation, he had ongoing pain at the time of postoperative review more specifically over the medial clavicular region. Review of the preoperative radiographs in two views did not reveal any injury to that region. Concomitant medial clavicle pathology was suspected given his ongoing pain and hence a computerised tomography scan (CT scan) was organised after the postoperative review which was 28 days after the injury (). The imaging revealed a comminuted intra-articular fracture of the medial end of the clavicle. This fracture was not appreciated on earlier imaging of the affected region nor on clinical examination during the initial presentation.\nHe underwent operative"}

He was apparently normal 4years back when he developed pain over the lower back which was insidious in onset, gradually progressive, intermittent in nature, radiating to bilateral lower limbs, aggravated on any movement of both lower limbs or turning sideways, decreased on restand medications. History of rest pain was present but no history of night cries or diurnal variations. He was mobilizing with walker during the first few years of pain but he developed complete inability to walk even with support for the past 1 year. There was no history of fever or trauma, loss of weight, or appetite. There was no history of loss of sensations in the upper or lower limbs and bowel or bladder incontinence. He also gave a history of intermittent diffuse pain in the chest and left elbow for the past 3years which was not progressive. Treatment history included medications for pain for the past 4years. There was no significant family history. General examination and systemic examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdomen showed no significant findings. There was diffuse tenderness over the dorsolumbar spine from D6-L4. Movements of both hips were severely painful with tenderness over the proximal femur. Neurological examination of the upper limbs was normal. Motor power of muscles acting on the hip and knee could not be assessed due to severe pain, but muscles acting on the ankle and foot were normal. There was no sensory blunting and perianal sensations were normal with normal anal sphincter contraction. Babinski response was normal. The findings suggested that there was no cord or cauda equina compression but the back and bilateral hips pain was causing a pain inhibition of the muscles acting on the hip and knee. On examination of the left elbow, swelling and tenderness were present over the proximal third ulna. Movements of the wrist and forearm were full but associated with mild pain."}

According to medical history, the patient landed on the rolling pin while doing some dancing training for a school play. She was taken to the local referral hospital where a perineal laceration was identified. Due to the nature of the wound, absence of symptoms and further clinical findings at initial clinical evaluation, as well as lack of a pediatric surgeon, the child was initially treated by the hospital’s gynecological team. She was taken to theatre for wound investigation and, according to their report, it was a penetrating wound that luckily did not injure neither the external genitalia, nor the anal sphincter. In the absence of further findings treatment was limited to suturing of the skin laceration.\nThe child was followed as an inpatient and remained symptom-free for a few hours; however, a massive bloody bowel movement raised significant concerns of the course of her treatment and a transfer to our department was arranged.\nOn arrival, the child was in a good general condition with normal vital signs; laboratory studies revealed a drop of hematocrit to 27.1% with hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL. On physical examination the abdomen was soft without any clinical signs of peritoneal irritation; a rectal examination was performed that revealed fresh blood in the rectum indicative of active bowel bleeding and a feeling of disruption of anterior bowel wall integrity. Due to high suspicion of colorectal injury an abdominal X-ray was performed that did not reveal any indications of bowel rupture or peritoneal contamination. Patient was scheduled and taken to theatre as soon as possible. A colonoscopy preceded any surgical intervention that identified an actively-bleeding anterior bowel wall laceration 2 cm above the dentate line. No further damage to the rest of the bowel was noted.\nAt that point, a wound investigation was decided and performed. The skin laceration was just lateral and to the right of the anus.

According to the parent, esophageal stenosis developed a year ago due to corrosive ingestion. Balloon dilatation was tried first in the patient who had two strictures, one proximal and one distal. When endoscopic balloon dilatations failed for the proximal stricture, a SEMS was placed. The stent was repositioned after two weeks because of stent migration. In the meantime, the patient could not be followed up for three months due to the civil war in the country. During this time, the patient's nutritional status gradually deteriorated. In the last examination, it was revealed that the stent had migrated distally and the proximal esophagus was severely narrowed. It was thought that the stent could not be removed endoscopically. Gastrostomy was not considered, and the boy was referred for esophageal replacement. When the patient came to our clinic, he was fed with liquid food only, which took a long time, and he had difficulty swallowing his saliva. The patient was hospitalized, and total parenteral nutrition was started. Esophageal passage graphy showed almost no passage (). When we performed endoscopy, we found almost complete obstruction (). In tomography, it was revealed that the proximal esophagus was extremely widened and the stent was approximately 1 cm below (). The lumen of the esophagus distal to the stent could not be evaluated. In the first stage, we aimed to excise the strictured part of the esophagus and remove the stent before the esophageal replacement. The strictured part of the esophagus was excised and the stent was removed via a right thoracotomy. On the fifth day, oral feeding was started and the thorax drain was removed on the 7th day. On the 14th day, the patient underwent endoscopy. The proximal esophagus was normal and balloon dilatation was applied to the distal stenosis. Distal stenosis was easily dilated. The patient was discharged on the 17th postoperative day without any problems. Now he is aged 4"}

Because of metastatic adenocarcinoma lung with the tumour demonstrating a mutation in exon 19 of the EGFR gene, she was considered suitable for primary palliative treatment with gefitinib and has been started on this medication three months earlier. Medical history also included palliative radiotherapy on her spine and right shoulder and treatment with morphine sulphate, diclofenac, and gabapentin.\nOn examination, her left eye had very poor vision of perception to light only. Slit-lamp examination revealed a shallow anterior chamber and a perforated corneal ulcer that measured 4.7 × 5 mm, which was plugged by the iris (). The eye was white with no conjunctival injection or anterior chamber cells. There was no evidence of meibomianitis or trichomegaly. It was difficult to visualise the fundus due to the corneal pathology but ultrasound examination demonstrated choroidal detachment with no evidence of intraocular metastasis. The right eye showed no abnormality with good vision.\nAs it was suspected that gefitinib could be the cause of her corneal ulcer, her oncologist decided to stop the medication due to the potential ocular toxicity, although gefitinib treatment had reduced her lung tumour size. Initial ophthalmic management included a bandage contact lens to reform the anterior chamber and topical antibiotics. A subsequent tectonic 6.25 mm corneal graft was performed without complication ().\nPost-operatively, her eye remained quiet, however, because of the development of a dense cataract, her vision only improved to hand movement. Two months after stopping the gefitinib treatment and while awaiting cataract surgery, she developed severe left retroorbital pain. On examination, she had iris prolapse through a melting corneal graft, and the crystalline lens was extruded (). This was managed initially with botulinum toxin injected into the upper lid producing a ptosis to provide protection for the eye and oral antibiotics were started.\nIt was agreed, after consultation"}

While in the resuscitation bay, bilateral chest tubes were placed for bilateral pneumothoraces and he had a positive FAST exam with tachycardia and severe hypotension (HR 128, BP 69/50). He was immediately brought to the operating room (OR) for emergency exploratory laparotomy, and splenectomy was performed for Grade V splenic injury, followed by abdominal packing without complete abdominal closure. His condition stabilized intraoperatively; no active abdominal bleeding or hematoma could be identified at that moment.\nA full-body CT scan was then requested to investigate other injuries. A list of numerous bone fractures that demonstrate the serious extent of the traumatic injury is shown in . The patient had also a scalp injury and needed additional workup to rule out traumatic brain injury. Head CT was negative. Chest CT demonstrated no further injuries other than minor pulmonary contusions and pneumothoraxes already being treated by the previously placed chest tubes. Abdominal contrasted CT identified a left renal artery injury and a nonenhancing ischemic left kidney but no other abdominal organ injuries (). In an attempt to salvage left kidney function despite over 4 hours of warm ischemia at that point, the patient was taken back to the OR for emergent repair of his left renal artery/in situ autotransplantation.\nAn occlusive 2 cm intra-arterial thrombus was removed, and a corresponding 2 cm damaged segment of the renal artery was excised. The kidney was flushed through the renal vein with histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate perfusion solution during the anastomosis of the renal artery. The left kidney was adequately perfused postreconstruction of the left renal artery ().\nDuring the two operations, the patient received a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells, 6 units"}
{"note": "A 30-year-old male with no prior medical history presented with nonradiating upper abdominal pressure and pain associated with early satiety and bloating. This was progressive over approximately 2 months before he sought medical attention. His physical exam demonstrated an easily visualized and palpable firm epigastric mass (). There were no signs of chronic liver disease such as ascites or jaundice.\nStandard tumor biomarkers such as CEA, AFP, and CA19-9 were normal, as was serum bloodwork for liver metabolic and synthetic function. Subsequent imaging workup demonstrated a large heterogeneous liver tumor approximately 27 × 13 × 20 cm in size, occupying his entire upper abdomen with mass effect and posterior displacement of the pancreas and stomach.\nMultiphase contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed the tumor originating from the left liver spanning segments 2, 3, and 4 with no evidence of biliary obstruction. However, the left portal vein was not well-visualized beyond the portal bifurcation suggesting severe compression or occlusion. Similarly, the middle and left hepatic veins were not seen (). There were felt to be reactive ascites and a right pleural effusion but no clear evidence for metastatic disease in the thorax or abdomen.\nPercutaneous biopsy showed spindle cells consistent with an undifferentiated sarcoma. After multidisciplinary review, the patient was considered a surgical candidate but preoperative downsizing might help from a technical standpoint. Tumor embolization was thought to be feasible and worth attempting to achieve this. The patient thus underwent bland embolization to the tumor via the left hepatic artery. Approximately two weeks after procedure, CT angiogram showed unfortunately no significant change in size although perhaps with some tumor necrosis related to the procedure.\nThis mass continued to be highly symptomatic and it was felt that further surveillance would result in being minimal if any shrinkage of the tumor; thus resection for both palliation and potential cure was attempted. Given normal preoperative liver function, it was felt that the anticipated liver remnant after left hepatectomy would be sufficient with little risk for posthepatectomy liver failure."}

The patient was initially admitted to a general medical floor, but his condition worsened within 24 hours and he went into septic shock and had to be transferred to the medical intensive care unit. He was hypotensive, tachycardic and tachypnic and had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation from sepsis. He was endotracheally intubated and placed on mechanical ventilatory support. Blood cultures grew Clostridium Difficile colitis. Appropriate antibiotics were started, and he was treated aggressively with intravenous fluids and also needed norepinephrine infusion for adequate blood pressure maintenance. He had a left subclavian central venous catheter inserted on the day of admission to the intensive care unit for administration of the vasopressor agent (Figure : Arrows show the tip of the central venous catheter abutted against the wall of superior vena cava).\nThe patient's condition improved and he was weaned off the norepinephrine by the third day. On the following day, patient suddenly became hypotensive. While he was being supported by aggressive resuscitative therapy, he had a chest radiograph done as part of the work up to diagnose the etiology of acute deterioration in the clinical condition. The chest radiograph showed widened mediastinum. A subsequent computed tomographic (CT) scan with intravenous contrast given through the left subclavian central venous catheter showed that the catheter had eroded through the wall of superior vena cava and there was extravasated contrast within the superior mediastinum (Figure : Computed scout image of the chest; arrows showing the extravasated contrast in the superior mediastinum; Figure : CT scan of chest with arrows showing the contrast in the mediastinum).

He had not suffered from any significant cardiac diseases apart from arrhythmia (single supraventricular extrasystoles) that did not require any medical treatment. Three months prior to the episode he had had his periodic exercise ECG, echocardiogram and Holter-ECG performed. None of them showed any contraindications for practising sport. Family history did not indicate any risk of vascular diseases either. After 3 h of the marathon race the patient started suffering binocular visual impairment in the form of flash lights variably narrowing his visual field. It was not accompanied by any other symptoms, neurological complaints or pain. The patient thought these symptoms were functional disorders caused by exhaustion and dehydration, so he only slowed down and finished the race. He did not suspect that this symptom might be caused by any trauma. After 2 h of rest the symptoms resolved spontaneously. After another 2 h the patient headed to the Accident and Emergency Department, where he underwent observation and was consulted by the neurologist, who did not recognize any abnormalities. He was also examined by the ophthalmologist and underwent ophthalmoscopy with the examination of acuity and field of vision. No abnormalities were found. He was discharged home with the diagnosis of function disorders caused by exhaustion. In another 7 days following the race the patient suffered only from permanent headaches, slightly more severe than the ones he used to complain about. Consequently he visited the neurologist again but again the examination did not reveal any abnormalities. He was referred for cervical spine X-ray and carotid artery Doppler ultrasound. The headache resolved after 8 days. Cervical spine X-ray did not reveal any significant abnormalities and Doppler ultrasound showed normal morphology of carotid arteries with no blood flow disturbances.

She returned to the emergency department the following day with headache and malaise and systolic blood pressure above 200 mmHg for which she was treated and discharged.\nShe returned to the emergency department again 5 days later, this time with complaints of word finding difficulty, blurred vision, and lower extremity tingling. Her blood pressure on presentation was 216/81 mmHg. She was admitted, and workup demonstrated no acute intracranial process or carotid stenosis. Echocardiography revealed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with a preserved ejection fraction. Her blood pressure continued to be refractory to medical therapy despite five antihypertensive agents and eventual initiation of an esmolol infusion. A renal artery ultrasound identified renal artery stenosis with flow at the arterial origin measuring 350 cm/s on the right and 208 cm/s on the left (); flow velocity in the supraceliac aorta was also noted to be elevated. She had no history of kidney disease and no elevation of her creatinine. Vascular surgery was consulted and a history of lower extremity claudication was elicited. On exam she had weak but palpable femoral pulses and an audible abdominal aortic bruit; ankle-brachial index measurements were deferred and the patient was scheduled for angiogram.\nThe patient underwent aortography the following day and on selective angiography the renal arteries were found to be widely patent.

The mass had a smooth surface and the overlying mucosa was not involved. An anterior rhinoscopic examination revealed normal mucosa and there was no mass in both the nasal cavities. Following a fine needle aspiration biopsy, the mass of the soft palate was considered to be a pleomorphic adenoma. The computed tomographic scan showed a round shaped, 4×4 cm sized mass with well enhanced soft tissue density in the soft palate without invasion of the adjacent tissues (), but the scan did not show a mass in any other region of the head and neck, including the sphenoid sinus (). Therefore, the mass was resected and the defect of the soft palate was not continuous into the nasal cavity. The defect of the soft palate was treated by primary closure without reconstruction. Histopathological examination of the specimen revealed the presence of a benign pleomorphic adenoma.\nOne year later, the patient visited the clinic due to a mass of the soft palate and diplopia that was present for the previous one month. On physical examination, a round shaped, 1×1 cm sized mass with a hard consistency and that was non-tender and fixed to the underlying soft tissue was seen.

Gastroscopy revealed a giant esophageal submucosal protrusion with a smooth surface that was located 20 to 26 cm from the incisors. Ultrasonic gastroscopy revealed a giant mucous prominence of the esophagus located 23 cm from the incisors that originated from the muscularis propria and was suspected to be a leiomyoma because of its smooth surface and normal color (Figure ). Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a round high-density shadow on the right front edge of the esophagus at the level of the aortic arch to the inferior pulmonary vein, and this was suspected to be a leiomyoma of the middle esophagus. Upper gastrointestinal contrast radiography showed a leiomyoma of the middle esophagus and compensatory expansion of the upper esophagus (Figure ). After preoperative preparation, surgery was performed under single-lumen endotracheal intubation. The patient was placed in the left lateral position. An incision was made in the eighth intercostal space at the right posterior axillary line, and a thoracoscope was introduced through the incision. For the operation, one incision was made in the seventh intercostal space between the right scapular line and the posterior axillary line, and another incision was made in the fourth intercostal space between the auscultatory triangle and the anterior axillary line (Figure ). Exploration revealed that the tumor had spread to the entire length of the thoracic esophagus. The pleura mediastinalis was incised above the diaphragm to expose the lower segment of the esophagus. The muscularis of the esophagus was cut to expose the capsule of the tumor, and a well-defined solid tumor with an intact capsule and rich blood supply was revealed.

The patient first underwent a modified radical mastectomy without breast reconstruction, followed by wide excision of the chest wall skin once angiosarcoma was confirmed. The EOM flap was used for delayed reconstruction of the patient’s chest wall defect which measured approximately 30 cm × 30 cm (Fig. ), a surface area of 900 cm2. The flap was elevated without the anterior rectus sheath, in the inter-fascial planes between the deep surface of the external oblique muscle and the superficial surface of the internal oblique, with minimal muscle mobilization, and with no sacrifice to the vascular pedicle or perforating vessels from the external oblique to the subcutaneous flap, which were all clearly identified and preserved during the procedure for safety precautions. It was then inserted with minimal tension. Further mobilization could easily have been performed with complete elevation of the muscle to the posterior axillary line and detachment of the EOM off its costal origins and its iliac crest insertion; care taken to avoid injury to its blood supply. The patient was discharged postoperative day #7 and was directed to shower and perform local wound care with Xeroform and abdominal pad dressings.

The patient was a heavy smoker, and did not report any history of trauma, recent medical intervention or known lithiasis. He denied any bleeding disorder and was not taking any medications. His blood pressure was normal and so were his blood count, biochemical and coagulation parameters. A rinsing catheter was introduced and the hematuria resolved within a few days. Ultrasonographic examination of the kidneys and bladder was unremarkable.\nOn a subsequent CT scan, a small soft tissue mass was depicted within the right renal pelvis. The lesion did not significantly enhance after injection of contrast medium and there was no dilatation of the affected renal unit. There was no evidence of urinary tract lithiasis or other pathology (Figure ).\nThe CT scan could not differentiate between a blood clot and a tumor. In the presence of a filling defect in the renal pelvis, although slightly enhancing, the presence of an urothelial lesion had to be excluded. Urine cytology was negative. A cystoscopy with advancement of a ureteral catheter into the right pelvis was carried out in order to selectively obtain a sample for urine cytology and perform a retrograde study. Cystoscopy and upper tract cytology were both negative for a high-grade bladder tumor. The retrograde study of the right ureter and pelvicaliceal system did not demonstrate any filling defect in the right renal pelvis and calyces. Based on these findings, the CT findings were attributed to a blood clot in the right renal pelvis and the investigation proceeded with renal arteriography.\nSelective right renal arteriography was carried out shortly following the resolution of the hematuria, and demonstrated an area of tortuous, coiled vascular channels with early filling of the renal vein within two seconds after the start of the injection(Figure ).

The angiographic findings were attributed to KD based on the proximal location and size of the aneurysms and the lack of another explanation for these findings.\nA cardiac computed tomography was performed, which revealed a giant thrombotic nonocclusive aneurysm in the proximal LAD with calcifications of the margins of the aneurysm (); the maximal outer size of the LAD aneurysm is 35 × 33 mm, and the size of the lumen of the LAD is 9 × 11 mm. Moderate aneurysmal dilatation of the proximal left circumflex and an ostial thrombotic aneurysm of the right coronary artery were observed.\nOne week after admission, the patient underwent coronary bypass surgery.

{"note": "Patient 1 is a 67-year-old male who presented to our clinic 41 years after his initial hip replacement. His initial surgery was performed in 1974, with the latest revision for periprosthetic infection 2 years prior to presentation to our clinic. He had undergone 5 previous surgeries and had a history of PJI with Escherichia coli at an outside hospital. On initial presentation, the patient had loose-appearing femoral stem with severe osteolysis (). He had a history of hypertension, deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, and asthma. After preoperative medical optimization, the patient underwent resection of proximal femur down to the distal femur metaphysis and placement of an MAAS (). He was allowed to partial weight bear to his affected limb postoperatively and was treated with 6 weeks of IV ceftriaxone. Intraoperative cultures grew E coli again. He underwent completion of his 2-stage reconstruction after 17.2 weeks using a tapered revision hip prosthesis in combination with a femoral allograft. An intramedullary nail with lateral locking plate was used for allograft fixation distally (). Patient opted to delay his second stage reconstruction after his antibiotic holiday as he was functioning well with the spacer and had several social challenges he needed to resolve prior to reimplantation. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein normalized prior to this surgery. This construct was chosen for several reasons. First, we did not wish to proceed with total femur replacement as this was our last option and patient had a native pain-free knee. Second, other proximal femur constructs would have been technically challenging, given the short amount of femur distally along with the difficulty obtaining fixation in the metaphysis of the femur versus the diaphysis. He was allowed to touch down weight bear in the immediate postoperative period after his reimplantation and then advanced to weight bear as tolerated at a later date. At his latest follow-up 1.15 years after reimplantation, patient was ambulating with pain-free range of motion of the hip and no recurrence of infection. The allograft showed signs"}
{"note": "In December 2017, a 57 year-old male was referred to the Oral Medicine Department of Dental Faculty of Babol University of Medical Sciences. The chief complaint was a massive and rapidly growing swelling in his left maxillary alveolar ridge after tooth extraction a month before. The lesion was a sessile exophytic mass with lobular surface which was erythematous in some areas. He also complained from spontaneous bleeding and tenderness. The whole lesion measurements were approximately 5cm x 5cm. The involved teeth including left maxillary canine and lateral incisor had mobility grade III ().\nBased on his own statements, the patient was considered as a heavy smoker who had been smoking for a long time and reported a history of having a lung malignancy since December 2016. A complete evaluation of his medical history was performed by exploring the documents of his previous hospitalization. First, after consulting with a lung specialist, a core needle biopsy from right lung mass was done and microscopic examination of sections revealed harboring neoplastic proliferation of epithelial cells with sheet and alveolar pattern. Neoplastic cells had large hyperchromatic nuclei, clear to granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. Inflammatory cell infiltration and multifocal necrosis were observed (). Immunohistochemistry showed strong positive reaction to CK7 and there was no response to CK20, TTF1 and CDX2. The pathologist determined it as non-small-cell carcinoma, probably TTF1 negative lung carcinoma.\nNo remarkable finding was shown by brain MRI taken in January 2017. Whole body bone scan was performed which showed abnormal increased uptake in the right first rib. The scan pattern suggested either a lung tumoral mass with the involvement of the first rib or radiotracer uptake by the soft tissue tumoral mass only (without bone involvement), therefore CT scan was recommended. The rest of skeleton was unremarkable. In February 2017, spiral CT of chest without contrast showed a mass lesion with ill-defined margins in the right lung apex with a maximum diameter of 62x30 millimeters in favor of a malignant process.

After the surgery, she reported to us that she had a fluid collection in the operation site after the surgery. She had received revision surgery four times during one year. Tissue culture and PCR analysis for mycobacteria were performed, but the results were all negative. The patient was afebrile and in good general health.\nRadiographs and MRI of the left hand were obtained one year after the initial surgery. The chest radiographs was normal and the hand radiographs revealed no bony abnormality. However, MRI of the hand showed a proliferative tenosynovitis of the flexor tendon sheath along the tracts of the flexor digitorum tendons involving from the wrist and mainly to the distal portion of the second digit. This lesion showed diffuse peripheral enhancement. The flexor tendons were intact and there were not any definite signal changes of the bone marrow (). At that time, her wrist pain was tolerable, so she did not receive any specific medical treatment and she'd just taken painkiller for three years.\nAs time went by, volar side wrist pain and a restricted range of motion of the left wrist had developed. She finally visited our hospital for further management and evaluation in 2010. On physical examination, there was 4 cm palpable mass-like lesion in the volar side of the left wrist, and tenderness on that lesion was also present. The blood tests showed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 27 mm/hr and a C-reactive protein level of 1.06 mg/L; the general hematologic and biochemical parameters were in the normal ranges. A radiograph revealed bony erosions along the margin of the left radiocarpal bones with osteoporotic change and the distance between the scaphoid and lunate was widened over 4 mm.

Three days before admission, the patient experienced convulsive seizure in the right upper limb while remaining conscious, which was relieved after 1 min. Similar attacks occurred intermittently on six further occasions. The patient had a 3-year history of hypertension with the highest blood pressure being 180/110 mmHg. He also had a history of smoking and drinking lasting more than 30 years. He was born and has always lived in Beijing, with no history of contact with infested water, infectious zone, other radioactive substances or toxins. Upon admission, the patient was examined to be obese with no subcutaneous nodules. Neurological examinations showed full level muscle strength in the right upper limb, accompanied with diminished needling response. Emergency head CT scan (2016-1-1) showed lower density in the left parietal lobe. As the patient manifested as an acute onset of right limb weakness and hemiparesis,with low density lesions in the left occipital lobe on CT and a history of hypertension, the patient was hospitalised with a preliminary diagnosis of acute stroke and secondary epilepsy.\nAfter hospitalisation, head MRI scan (2016-1-4) displayed a lesion in the left parietal lobe of unknown nature. After enhancement in the magnetic field, a larger area of oedema was found around the lesion in the left parietal lobe which could indicate glioma or other inflammatory diseases. Since the nature of the brain lesion did not match the characteristics of common cerebrovascular diseases, intracranial angiography DSA was used but found no obvious vascular abnormalities or stenosis.

The patient attended our department on April 27, 2004, one week after the injury, when the vision in the left eye decreased to light perception with inaccurate light projection and hand movements in a lower part of visual field. The best-corrected visual acuity in the right eye was 1.0. Intraocular pressures were 18 mmHg in the right eye and 45 mmHg in the left eye. Examination of the anterior segment and fundus of the right eye revealed no pathology. The left eye showed discrete injection of the conjunctiva and keratic precipitates with mild anterior chamber flare and cells. There was iridodonesis, cleft syndrome and a relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye. The fundus examination of the left eye revealed swelling of the optic disc, large ischemic macular edema, superficial retinal hemorrhages, narrowing of the arterioles and dilatation of the venules (Figure ). Fluorescein angiography of the left eye showed macular edema and vascular leakage in the venous phase (Figure ). Duplex Doppler ultrasonography and computed tomography scans of the brain and orbits were normal.\nBased on the clinical findings, the presumed diagnosis of ocular ischemic syndrome was made. The patient was initially treated with vaso-active drugs in addition to corticosteroids. Intravenous methylprednisolone (500 mg daily for 5 days) followed by 60 mg of oral prednisone daily was indicated due to swelling of the optic disc and macular edema.

The lesion originated in the ascending branch of the left mandible, and the first surgical procedure was performed in March 1997 followed by disease recurrence in April 1999. A second resection was performed in May 1999, and during the next 16 years, the patient underwent several surgical approaches that were consistently followed by disease recurrence. Some of the procedures were conservative surgeries, but others were radical procedures that left her with several deforming scars. She presented to our clinic in January 2015 with a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that evidenced a right, triangular aspect, paracellarlesion, extending to the homolateral cavernous sinus (13 × 9 mm), which was suspected to be a residual lesion that would have achieved the cavernous sinus by contiguity growth after several surgeries. Her last surgery had been performed in April 2014 and was followed by local radiotherapy in May 2014. She was asymptomatic and not willing to undergo a new invasive procedure. She decided to be followed without further intervention.\nFor the next 18 months, she was clinically stable and asymptomatic, but she returned in July 2016 with intense pain on the right side of her face that required multiple hospital visits for intravenous analgesia. MRI revealed an extensive heterogeneous lesion with contrast enhancement centered on the right cavernous sinus anterior to the cavus of Meckel and exhibiting anterior extension towards the upper orbital fissure (measuring approximately 19 × 15 × 16 mm). To identify new treatment possibilities, we decided to perform a new biopsy and conduct molecular testing (Fig. ). A BRAF mutational analysis by the allele-specific protein chain reaction (PCR) certified test revealed the presence of a BRAF c.1799 T > A;p.V600E mutation corresponding to a V600E amino acid substitution.

{"note": "A 42-year-old female patient presented with a history of failed endodontics followed by extraction and socket preservation in relation to #31 six months prior to reporting to the implant clinic. The adjacent teeth #32 and #41 showed endodontic restorations. After clinical and radiological evaluation it was decided to place a 3.0 × 12 mm single piece implant$. Adequate primary stability was obtained at the time of placement. When reviewed after six weeks, the site showed signs of abscess formation in the alveolar mucosa in relation to implant #31. There was no evidence of probing depth around the implant, but radiographs revealed peri-implant bone loss at the middle third region. The implant was found to be stable with no mobility. Open flap debridement was done and the implant surface decontaminated with universal implant deplaquer$$. The implant was subsequently followed up for a period of one year with regular three-month clinical and radiological reviews.\nThe normal peri-implant sulcus depth and absence of other inflammatory signs in the peri-implant mucosa suggests that anterograde peri-implantits was not the cause for bone loss observed in this case. Even though endodontic therapy was performed in the adjacent teeth, placement of implant might have triggered latent periapical pathology[] from the adjacent teeth. Recent evidence suggests the existence of an autoimmune response[] in the periapical area in relation to an antigen which may be microbial in origin. The host response that is triggered off, may affect the host tissues as a result of similarity between the microbial and the host antigens, such as the heat shock proteins. In such instances, even after thorough debridement of the root canal has resulted in elimination of the microbial antigens, the host response may ensure continuation of an active inflammatory process.\nThe process of implant placement could result in activation of this latent response either due to overheating or contamination or a combination of both. This activation could have resulted in the rapid bone loss in a short period of time. The importance of periodic clinical"}

The first episode of flaccid paresis occurred during her first pregnancy at the age of 23 years with a fall from the couch when she could not move her right arm and leg for several minutes, without associated disturbance of cognition or sensory symptoms. Examination at the emergency room after recovery was normal. Brain imaging was not performed because of the pregnancy. Two subsequent EEGs were normal, and no specific diagnosis was made at the time. She had a history of migraine, and we cannot definitively exclude the possibility that this first episode of unilateral weakness was a migraine aura without headache. However, her typical migraine episodes are headache and are distinct from this presentation. Fifteen years later, while driving, she noted weakness of her arms, legs, and trunk severe enough to warrant stopping the car. Weakness recovered slowly after 15 minutes. A similar episode occurred a few months later. Potassium levels and clinical examination when asymptomatic were normal. Subsequently, the frequency of similar episodes with flaccid paresis of her limbs, affecting predominantly the legs and lasting several minutes, increased and they occurred daily, always after resting. No correlation with food intake or fasting was reported. In addition, she complained of painless cramps in her arms and legs muscles, which could become painful if she tried to stretch her muscles. These lasted up to 10 minutes and also occurred during sleep.\nA detailed neurologic examination at the age of 42 years revealed no abnormalities. A relatively thin and long face with a small lower jaw was noted, but she was not overtly dysmorphic.

Emergency head CT scan (2016-1-1) showed lower density in the left parietal lobe. As the patient manifested as an acute onset of right limb weakness and hemiparesis,with low density lesions in the left occipital lobe on CT and a history of hypertension, the patient was hospitalised with a preliminary diagnosis of acute stroke and secondary epilepsy.\nAfter hospitalisation, head MRI scan (2016-1-4) displayed a lesion in the left parietal lobe of unknown nature. After enhancement in the magnetic field, a larger area of oedema was found around the lesion in the left parietal lobe which could indicate glioma or other inflammatory diseases. Since the nature of the brain lesion did not match the characteristics of common cerebrovascular diseases, intracranial angiography DSA was used but found no obvious vascular abnormalities or stenosis. Further examinations including lumbar puncture, immune rheumatoid factors and parasite antibody detections were carried out. A raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure was found to (215 mm H2O) with no red or"}

She had no history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and trauma to the head and neck. The palpable mass was pulsatile and had a diameter of 5 cm. Intraoral examination was unremarkable. A computed tomography (CT) () and a magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrated the presence of a 5-cm left submandibular gland tumor, whereas contrast-enhanced CT () and ultrasonography revealed a 3.8 × 3.3 cm aneurysm of the facial artery with a cystic structure. We judged a submandibular tumor with pseudoaneurysm or a true aneurysm and suggested treatment options for the mass. The patient selected surgical excision under general anesthesia in response to the pathological diagnosis and to ensure the recovery of her esthetic appearance. We, therefore, consulted endovascular surgeons for angiography and internal trapping before the surgical excision, considering that there was a risk of bleeding during the operation.\nA parent vessel occlusion was performed with coils by endovascular surgeons from the distal to the proximal side of the aneurysm under local anesthesia (). After the endovascular trapping with coils, the facial mass was non-pulsatile.\nA total of 8 days after the internal trapping, the patient underwent an operation for excision of the aneurysm under general anesthesia. Skin incision was made using the submandibular approach at 4-cm below the inferior border of the mandible, thus exposing the facial artery and the aneurysm. The mass adhered to a left submandibular gland and the gland did not have any structural change. We, therefore, isolated and saved the gland from the mass. Subsequently, we ligated the facial artery and excised the mass, and then closed the skin using a 5-0 nylon suture (, ). The histopathological examination of the excised mass confirmed a true aneurysm of the facial artery with organized thrombus. There was no bleeding from the wound during or after surgery. The postoperative course was uneventful; the patient had no"}

At the time of admission, the physical examination revealed no abnormal findings, her blood pressure was 155/80 mmHg, her height was 185 cm and weight was 95 kg. She was on standard antidepressant therapy and flavonoids.\nAt the time of admission, the electrocardiogram was normal, D-dimers were elevated to 4170 μg/l and high-sensitive troponin T was negative. The CT computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed a dilated aortic root and a Stanford type B aortic dissection. The left vertebral artery originated atypically from the true lumen of aortic arch as a third branch just before the origin of left subclavian artery. The right vertebral artery was hypoplastic. The left renal and accessory renal artery flow originated from the false lumen and the dissection extended to the origin of the left common iliac artery. Transesophageal echocardiography showed an intimal flap extending through the whole length of the descending aorta with a small mobile echogenic structure in the proximal part of the false lumen. The aortic root was dilated to 51 × 54 mm and the aortic valve was tricuspid with an insignificant central regurgitation jet. The left ventricular function was normal, without regional wall motion abnormalities. Mild regurgitation of the mitral and tricuspid valves without signs of mitral valve prolapse was noted (Fig. a, b). Digital subtraction angiography was also performed and confirmed the type B aortic dissection. It also revealed that compression of the true lumen is not as significant as the CT angiography showed before.

Her symptoms began 11 months prior to diagnosis when she initially fell on her hip and felt a bump with associated pain. In the emergency room, the initial history and physical examination resulted in the diagnosis of a hematoma around her proximal femur. Her symptoms worsened over the next nine months and she experienced recurrent falls. Radiographic imaging six weeks prior to her initial cancer diagnosis did not reveal significant abnormalities. Due to the concern for a possible hip fracture, a CT scan without intravenous contrast was obtained. While the CT confirmed no displaced fracture, it indicated clinical correlation for a nonspecific left thigh tissue collection suggestive of a hematoma. An MRI was obtained after the CT and demonstrated a soft-tissue mass in the subcutaneous tissue of the left hip suspicious for sarcoma. The patient had a consultation with an orthopedic oncologic specialist one week following the MRI and underwent a radical resection of the sarcoma the next day.\nThe pathology report revealed a 13.5 cm superficial left hip undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma with 50-60% necrosis. Margins were negative, with the closest evidence of cancer being 2 mm within surgical margins. A staging chest CT one week after surgery demonstrated two tiny lung nodules with the larger nodule measuring 4 mm which indicated a recommended follow up of three to six months. Of note, there was also a small hypodense lesion in the spleen that was inadequately visualized. Tumor stage was established to be Stage III measuring 13.5 cm at its greatest dimension. The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging was established to be pT2a, cN0, cM0 without evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastases.

He had a urological past medical history significant for low risk Gleason 3 + 3 prostate cancer (1/12 cores positive of right prostatic lobe only) treated with primary right-sided prostatic focal cryotherapy in 1996. His prostate cancer had been detected as a result of an elevated PSA and an abnormal digital rectal examination. At time of cryotherapy, he had no prostatic calcifications visible on TRUS or CT scan. Since his treatment, his serum PSA levels had been undetectable, and two subsequent CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis were negative for lymphadenopathy or evidence of metastatic disease. In addition, he had previously undergone a subtotal parathyroidectomy for hypercalcemia that had hence resolved before his diagnosis of prostate cancer.\nPhysical examination of the patient revealed an alert and oriented male with minimal suprapubic tenderness. On digital rectal examination, the prostate was approximately 40 grams and smooth without irregularity. He had a 500 cc postvoid residual. The remainder of physical examination was within normal limits. Urine analysis was positive for leukocyte esterase and 26 WBC per HPF. His serum PSA was undetectable. A noncontrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed bilateral renal cysts without hydronephrosis and a 17 × 15 × 12 mm calcification of the right lobe of the prostate ().\nThe decision was made to proceed with TURP to relieve the obstruction as his symptoms had not improved with oral tamsulosin and finasteride. General anesthesia was induced, and a 22F cystoscope was passed through the urethra into the bladder without obvious signs of obstruction or trauma. Upon further investigation, there was enlargement of the right lateral lobe of the prostate from a protruding and visible calcified growth at the right bladder neck consistent with the previous CT findings.

The patient showed a progressive exacerbation of his MDD over a period of one year after losing his job in construction, and increasing marital distress. He was found hanging from a rope with a suicide note, by family members. Family accounts indicated his last interaction was three minutes prior to being found hanging. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) was activated after the patient was successfully released from the hanging rope but was found to be unresponsive. EMS indicated that on arrival, they found the patient in a decorticate position with pupils fixed, and in state of a cardiac arrest. He was successfully resuscitated but remained unconscious.\nOn arrival in the emergency room, routine examination and radiological workup showed no evidence of carotid intimal dissection, thrombus formation, tracheal stenosis, cervical spinal injury or spinal cord injury. However, there was superficial soft tissue injury on the neck along the tracks of the rope used for hanging. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), with interventions including mechanical ventilation with a target oxygen saturation of 94%-98% and a target arterial blood gas pO2 of 70-100 mmHg and pCO2 of 40 mmHg and monitoring for complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and further cardiac arrest and raised intracranial pressure. His course in the ICU indicated he was maintained at a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 100 mmHg with an intermittent need for a dose of adrenaline not exceeding 20 mcg/min. His ICU course was complicated by the development of aspiration pneumonia for which he was managed with 2 g of cefepime intravenously every 12 hours for seven days and vancomycin for a total of 2 g divided as 500 mg every six hours.

A computed tomographic (CT) scan of his abdomen did not demonstrate any intraabdominal abnormality. An empiric diagnosis of infectious diarrhea with dehydration was made and the patient was discharged back to his facility on Levofloxacin and Metronidazole and intravenous fluids. Three days later, he represented to the emergency department with persistent diarrhea and a metabolic acidosis. A repeat CT scan was obtained which demonstrated an ill-defined rectosigmoid mass, but no obstruction. The pulmonary artery was seen on the uppermost cuts of this scan and there was no evidence of pulmonary embolus at this time (Figure ). Sigmoidoscopy revealed no mass or mucosal abnormality and the patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with continued broad spectrum antibiotics, intravenous hydration and hemodynamic monitoring. He was hemodynamically stable. Sequential compression devices were documented to be in place for DVT/PE prophylaxis.\nOn hospital day two, the patient developed increasing abdominal tenderness which was associated with fevers up to 39.5 degrees Celsius and acute renal failure. Surgery was consulted and recommended urgent operative exploration. Upon exploration the patient was found to have mesenteric venous thrombosis with a segment of ischemic small bowel. He underwent small bowel resection and was returned to the intensive care unit for continued resuscitation. At this time a heparin infusion was initiated given the patient's known factor XII deficiency and demonstrated mesenteric venous thrombosis.

She felt this was as a result of a spinal injury she sustained while giving birth to her son. A magnetic resonance image of her spine only revealed disc degeneration. Prior to 2003 the patient had 14 admissions to hospital for these symptoms. Her mental health deteriorated over the days preceding admission and this manifested itself by hopelessness, despair and suicidal ideation. She felt she was a rotting corpse and expressed the wish of wanting to die. There were no current or previous attempts to commit suicide. She was low in mood and suffered from anhedonia. The patient displayed hostile behaviour. She also experienced reduced concentration, early morning awakening and a suppressed appetite. Furthermore, she was unable to shower because of the pain in her legs and consequently her personal hygiene deteriorated. The patient explained that the blood circulation to her legs was compromised therefore resulting in her legs rotting and falling off. In her opinion, she felt she had always been misdiagnosed and was pre-occupied about this.

She presented with a combined crouch and spastic gait pattern. Both hips internally rotated during gait with an equinus foot position, however, she was able to ambulate and ride a bicycle without assistance. She was able to climb stairs one step at a time. She initially twisted and injured the right knee in a fall from a bicycle in 1999. The obvious injury was not pointed out in X-ray examination by the local physician, and the injury was left untreated at that time. She reported an uncomfortable sensation in her right knee since her fall in 1999. She again experienced pain and instability in the right knee while walking and using the stairs in 2001. X-ray, CT and physical examination by another local physician diagnosed an avulsion fracture involving the ACL at the tibial insertion with an intraarticular loose body (Figure A and B). Arthroscopic resection of the loose body and fixation of the avulsed bone fragment under pull-out technique was performed in 2001. Bone healing at the ACL tibial insertion site was not successful and symptoms still remained. An additional surgery for resection of the bone fragment at the tibial ACL insertion was performed in 2003.

He was in a stable relationship and the father of two children, both in their twenties, from a previous marriage. After completing high school he had earned a university degree in education of children with disabilities, which was also his current profession. His alcohol consumption was moderate and he did not smoke tobacco. Despite his relatively young age, his medical record contained a comprehensive list of previous diseases. At age 25 he underwent fundoplication because of gastric reflux. The procedure was repeated 3 years later due to persisting symptoms. At 29 he was diagnosed as having Hodgkin’s lymphoma. He initially received combination chemotherapy of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, but this was terminated due to development of leg weakness. To compensate for chemotherapy intolerance, he subsequently received radiotherapy toward lymph nodes in his neck with a total of 40 gray. Consequently, he developed hypothyroidism as a side effect.\nHe had previously been on thyroid hormone replacement therapy for 7 years. During these years he had been changing the thyroxine medication from synthetic levothyroxine to a preparation derived from porcine thyroid glands, before ending up with a combination of the two.

The ascites was explained by poorly regulated atrial fibrillation aggravated by mild anemia which upon correction improved slightly.\nApart from atrial fibrillation the patient had no significant past medical history prior to transplantation.\nThe patient had no significant personal or family history.\nEighteen months post transplantation he developed dyspnea with severe fatigue and peripheral edema with prominent ascites and a significant weight gain. The presenting signs of right-sided heart failure were highly suggestive of cardiac etiology.\nCardiac catheterisation revealed slightly elevated pressures in all four chambers and equalization of diastolic chamber pressures also known as the square root sign. This is the typical presentation of constrictive pericarditis and computed tomography showed excessive pericardial calcifications (Figures and ). The patient underwent an open pericardiectomy. The procedure was complicated by acute kidney injury which required intermittent hemodialysis. This was followed by improvement of the patient’s general condition as well as of his renal function. There were no other complications related to the procedure. Following pericardiectomy, ascites improved dramatically with complete regression"}

She was diagnosed with Behçet disease at the age of 34 years; she presented with recurrent oral ulceration, recurrent genital ulceration, and pseudofolliculitis with characteristic acneiform nodules. She had no eye lesions. Her condition was well controlled with prednisolone (PSL) 8 mg/day oral dose. She fell pregnant spontaneously and visited our perinatal center for her prenatal care. As she was detected with hypertension at her first visit, we recommended that she check her blood pressure regularly at home. She developed fever, oral ulcers, and arthralgia at 16 weeks of gestation, due to which a relapse of Behçet disease was suspected. Because her condition was controlled well with PSL, the daily oral dose of PSL was increased from 8 mg to 10 mg. At this time, ulceration and pain of the vulva were not observed. She visited our outpatient clinic for a regular prenatal examination at 18 weeks and 4 days of gestation, which was when an ulcer localized in the vagina was incidentally observed (). The ulcer was painless and the patient had no symptoms in the vulva either (). Chlamydial and gonococcal infection were not detected, and cytology of the vaginal wall showed no findings suggesting malignancy. As the other symptoms of Behçet disease were resolved after the dose of PSL had been increased, the same dose was maintained. At the next prenatal care visit, at 22 weeks and 4 days of gestation, the vaginal ulcer had disappeared and other symptoms of Behçet disease were not seen. At 28 weeks and 0 days of gestation, atypical genital bleeding and vaginal ulcer recurrence were observed (). At the same time, recurrence of the oral ulcer and arthralgia as well as a mild increase in the fever were observed; based on these symptoms, she was diagnosed with a relapse of Behçet disease and the daily dose of PSL was increased from 10 mg to 15 mg.

She subsequently underwent bilateral simultaneous total knee replacement surgery under general anaesthesia and with the use of tourniquet throughout. A standard medial parapatellar incision was used. A rotating platform prosthesis (LCS, Depuy, Warsaw) with uncemented femoral and tibial components was utilised, and the patellae were resurfaced with a cemented all polyethylene patella components. A satisfactory intraoperative result was obtained in both knees with a range of movement from 0 to 125. The deep layer of the medial collateral ligaments was partially released from the tibia for access during the procedure but no other soft tissue releases were required. The patient made an uneventful initial postoperative recovery and was discharged at day five after surgery. At 2 weeks after operation, she had obtained a range of motion of 0 to 90. At 10 weeks after operation she presented with a range of motion of 30 to 75 affecting the left knee only. By 12 weeks, she had decreased this range of motion of 40 to 75 with the left knee and 5 to 75 affecting the right knee. She had suffered no trauma to the knee. Blood tests revealed a CRP of 9, ESR of 85, and WCC of 4.7. Aspiration of the joint did not reveal any evidence of infection. X-rays showed calcification around the knee including the quadriceps tendon (Figures , , and ). After a review of the literature, a decision was made to treat the loss of range of motion nonoperatively, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (Diclofenac 50 mg tds) and other regular types of analgesia and physiotherapy. Physiotherapy consisted of weekly session focusing on range of movement exercises with additional sessions of hydrotherapy.

The mass had existed for at least six months and was slowly increasing in size. Hypertension, diabetes, hyperuricemia, and hypercholesterolemia were mentioned in the medical history. No previous significant pathology or surgery was reported in the head and neck area. Computed and magnetic tomography, with 1.25 mm thickness cuts in the transverse plane and with image reconstruction cuts of 1.25 and 2.5 mm in coronal and sagittal planes, respectively, revealed a lesion of 1.64 cm × 4.8 cm in dimensions which occupied the right buccal space, originating from the right major zygomaticus muscle, and extending to the right anterior part of the parotid gland (Figures and ). There was homogeneity in composition with a distinguishable contrast intake in comparison with the healthy side and discrete vessels throughout the circumference of the lesion. The tumor had smooth outlined limits with projections in the anterior area of the right parotid gland and the lateral portion of the masseter muscle. A malignant lesion in the buccal space could not be excluded from the differential diagnosis. However, the characteristics of the lesion were not exactly compatible with typical malignancies of the area, including salivary gland carcinoma and lymphoma. Blood tests did not reveal any specific findings, with white blood test count on the lower normal levels. The patient did not present any B-type symptoms or showed any signs of localized lymphadenopathy. FNA biopsy was performed, retrieving numerous lymphocytes and nonspecific atypical cells, and was characterized as nondiagnostic (). The patient refused to undergo a second FNA biopsy. The decision for excision under general anesthesia was then taken as the possibility of a malignant lesion could not be excluded.

She did not report any previous episodes of constipation. She was reviewed at our emergency department and was found to have a distended tympanic abdomen that was soft all over with no tenderness. Bowel sounds were sluggish and a digital rectal examination revealed an empty rectum. A plain abdominal film showed a hugely dilated loop of bowel, arising from her pelvis, which had the appearance of a coffee bean (Fig. ). The plain abdominal radiograph confirmed the presence of a sigmoid volvulus. A rectal tube was inserted carefully to decompress the volvulus which succeeded and gave her immediate relief from her symptoms. She was admitted to our pediatric surgical ward and had a nasogastric tube inserted and was started on intravenously administered antibiotics. The next day she was asymptomatic but a contrast enema showed the twist to be evident with an incomplete obstruction (Fig. ). Due to the findings on contrast enema she went for endoscopic decompression of the volvulus under general anesthesia. The twist was causing venous congestion and was successfully reduced (Fig. ). A rectal tube was left in place post endoscopic reduction for 24 hours. She was asymptomatic thereafter but her parents requested discharge and they were granted their wish as they wanted to travel to their country. In her country she was investigated and was advised conservative management and observation. A month after her previous attack, and after she had returned to Bahrain from her native country, she presented with the same signs and symptoms that she had in our institution with the same radiological findings but this time the volvulus could not be decompressed by a rectal tube at the emergency department or by endoscopy (Fig. ). Her parents were advised that she should undergo surgery to which they consented. As this was considered an emergency, her bowel was not prepared."}

Pulp vitality testing with an electric pulp tester revealed an exaggerated response compared to the clinically normal adjacent and contralateral teeth. Cold and heat testing of the tooth also showed a positive response. The pre-operative radiograph of the tooth () confirmed the occlusal carious lesion approaching the pulp and there was discontinuation of the apical lamina dura.\nThe wide pulp canal space till the middle third of the canal showed a sudden thinning that led to the suspicion that there was a variation in the morphology. An angled radiograph showed that the mandibular first premolar also showed a similar morphology. () The radiograph of the contralateral side also showed a similar morphology. ()\nBased on the clinical, radiologic and electric pulp testing findings, a diagnosis of acute irreversible pulpitis with acute apical periodontitis was made and a nonsurgical endodontic treatment was planned. The treatment plan was explained to the patient and his consent was obtained. The tooth was anesthetized with 2% lidocaine solution with adrenaline through inferior alveolar nerve block injection of the right side and a standard access cavity was prepared after rubber dam isolation on the mandibular right second premolar. The oval access cavity preparation revealed two canal orifices that was then modified to a triangular shape to reveal the third orifice ().\nThe pulp was extirpated from all the three canals and the working length was determined using an electronic apex locator (Root ZX, J.

On physical examination, a round, 2.0×1.5 cm sized erythematous mass was observed on her right cheek. The patient complained of a slight itching sense, but neither pain nor tenderness was observed. The patient had no specific underlying disease, no history of operation, no history of radiation therapy and no familial history of cancer.\nPunch biopsy was performed at the dermatology department and the pathological findings confirmed the diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma. The patient and her family were hesitant to undergo surgery because of her old age. About 7 months later, the patient revisited us for surgery with a significantly enlarged 5.5×4.5×4.0 cm sized mass (). It was confirmed that the mass began to grow rapidly about 2 weeks ago without trauma or any specific medical history. It showed focal ulceration with yellowish purulent discharge. The patient suffered from pain, and mild tenderness was also observed. However, there was no localized or generalized lymphadenopathy and her facial nerve function was intact.\nWe recommended other radiologic examinations to identify the degree of tumor invasion and metastasis, but those could not be progressed because the patient and her family wanted only a palliative treatment.\nUnder general anesthesia, the mass was widely excised with a safety margin of 5 mm, and superficial parotidectomy was performed because of tumor invasion to the parotid gland (). Based on the result of frozen biopsy, the resection margin was clear, so that we could preserve the facial nerve branches (). The resulting defect was covered with a transposition flap from the ipsilateral posterior auricular area () and the donor site was closed primarily ().\nA histopathologic examination of the excised mass showed a poorly differentiated sebaceous carcinoma with a clear resection margin ().

The mechanism of injury suggested axial loading of the thumb between the vehicle and the wall. He presented directly to the emergency department with severe pain, swelling, and an obvious deformity at the wrist. The patient had no background medical or surgical history of note and reported no previous injuries to the affected limb. He was an active smoker of 30 cigarettes per day.\nOn examination in the emergency department, he had significant pain and swelling in the left wrist and forearm. There was a superficial abrasion over the dorsal aspect of the affected hand; however, this was considered to be a closed injury. There was significant tenderness over the carpals, particularly at the trapezium, with associated reduced range of motion at the wrist and thumb. There was no neurovascular compromise or associated tendon injury.\nThe AP radiograph reveals disruption of the continuation of arc I between the proximal border of the triquetrum and the proximal border of the trapezium, with the trapezium displaced in a radial direction (). This represents a volar dislocation of the trapezium. There was no associated fracture of the trapezium or any other associated bony injuries.\nThe patient subsequently underwent closed manipulation under general anesthesia. The surgeon achieved anatomical reduction by gripping the patient's thumb in one hand and applying a distracting force, while simultaneously applying pressure on the radial aspect of the trapezium with the thumb of the surgeon's other hand.

She underwent a craniotomy and subtotal resection of the lesion that was diagnosed as an anaplastic astrocytoma. The postoperative course was complicated by postoperative hemorrhage, extended mechanical ventilation, a tracheostomy, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. The patient had a very gradual and slow recovery but remained densely hemiparetic in the right leg, with facial droop and cognitive dysfunction. She did not receive any postoperative adjuvant treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy; treatment for the brain tumor was offered to the patient but was declined by her and her family. In 2012, she developed a pulmonary embolism and was anticoagulated with fragmin. In 2013, she had an episode of acute pain in the left forearm, and recommendations for more diagnostic tests to rule out a potential malignant transformation of her bony tumors were declined by the patient who also refused any further diagnostic or therapeutic measures.\nShe was recently seen in the clinic in September 2014 and was remarkably stable despite the lack of any postoperative adjuvant therapy. On examination, she continues to have right facial droop and right hemiparesis but with intact cranial nerves II–XII. Left arm was immobile due to pain but the left leg had full strength. The patient had moderate expressive aphasia but followed requests and answered simple questions easily. There were no spasticity or contractures present.

He was scheduled for revision of an arteriovenous fistula on the right arm because of occlusion of the fistula. He had a prosthetic mitral valve and an intravenous pacemaker that had been set to 65 beats per minute in ventricular back-up mode for 15 years. The pacemaker had been implanted because he had suffered from acute mitral regurgitation due to rupture of the chordae tendinae associated with myoxomatous degeneration of the mitral leaflets and sick sinus syndrome 2 months after the prosthetic mitral valve surgery. The patient’s medical history also included hypothyroidism and chronic hepatitis B with thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly but not chronic obstructive lung diseases (COPD). Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF = 53 %) with a restrictive pattern of LV inflow, as indicated by a 2.3 ratio of early transmitral inflow peak velocity to atrial transmitral inflow peak velocity, suggesting elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate pulmonary hypertension was diagnosed, with a 48-mmHg tricuspid valve pressure gradient calculated from the tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity. There were no abnormalities in the native aortic valve or the prosthetic mitral valve.\nIn the operating room, we started continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) on standard lead II, automated noninvasive measurement of blood pressure every 5 min, and measurement of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2).

In May 2004, after he experienced anterior chest pain, computed tomography (CT) was performed. This revealed in the sternum a low density mass that gradually increased in size during the following three months. In September 2004, there was an 8 × 7 cm mass, and destruction of some of the cortical bone of the manubrium sterni had occurred, so a CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy was performed. (Fig. ) The mass was composed of clear tumor cells arranged in an alveolar configuration, and metastatic renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed histologically. (Fig. ) We performed distant metastasis check up and check his physical function preparing for an operation. No evidence of other distant metastases was seen. We took a chest CT prior to the operation after an admission, the tumor shadow was the same comparing with previous chest CT before the biopsy. The patient underwent a partial resection of the sternal bone with wide margin including whole tumor tissue in November 2004. The postoperative clinical course was uneventful and the patient was discharged 11 days later. Pathological examination revealed only granulation tissue which composed of wide bleeding area and necrosis area with strong infiltration of inflammatory cells especially for fibroblasts. The entire resected tissue specimen was checked carefully, but no carcinoma cells were detected.

A second resection was performed in May 1999, and during the next 16 years, the patient underwent several surgical approaches that were consistently followed by disease recurrence. Some of the procedures were conservative surgeries, but others were radical procedures that left her with several deforming scars. She presented to our clinic in January 2015 with a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that evidenced a right, triangular aspect, paracellarlesion, extending to the homolateral cavernous sinus (13 × 9 mm), which was suspected to be a residual lesion that would have achieved the cavernous sinus by contiguity growth after several surgeries. Her last surgery had been performed in April 2014 and was followed by local radiotherapy in May 2014. She was asymptomatic and not willing to undergo a new invasive procedure. She decided to be followed without further intervention.\nFor the next 18 months, she was clinically stable and asymptomatic, but she returned in July 2016 with intense pain on the right side of her face that required multiple hospital visits for intravenous analgesia.

The tibial fragment measured 11 × 4 mm and presented a maximal displacement of 7 mm. No other ligamentous, meniscal, or chondral injuries were observed in a magnetic resonance imaging examination (\n). Because of minimal displacement, we decided to treat the avulsion fracture in a conservative way. The knee was immobilized for 6 weeks, with a long leg cast with 30 degrees of knee flexion.

Secondary survey revealed bruise over the right chest, decreased air entry on the right side, central placed mediastinal structures and normal heart sounds. Rest of his examination was normal.\nAfter resuscitation the patient was taken for CT scan of abdomen and chest. CT showed free fluid in the abdominal cavity, a right sided retroperitoneal haematoma, a right lung contusion, a right haemothorax and the presence of right sided chest tube (). The diaphragm was noted at higher level but it could not be determined whether there was any injury to it (). Subsequently the patient was subjected to exploratory laparotomy because a TDR could not be ruled out by imaging. At surgery note was made of complete rupture of the right dome of the diaphragm with almost the whole liver in the right chest. The retroperitoneal haematoma was found to be non-expanding and about 300 ml of blood was found in the abdominal cavity. The right lower lobe of lung was contused, the pericardium was torn on the right side and its edges were bleeding. The pericardial edges were cauterized, the liver returned to the abdominal cavity and the diaphragm repaired with 2/0 prolene interrupted mat"}
{"note": "A 21-year-old male patient reported in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery with a progressive limitation of mouth opening and swelling on the left temporal region since two months. The patient had a history of trauma to the left temporal region two months back, which was a hit by a heavy vehicle jack rod. As there were no fractures of the facial/skull bones or any other complications at the time of injury, symptomatic treatment was given to the patient at a local hospital.\nOn local examination, a gross swelling was noticed in the left temporal region, which was soft in consistency and non-tender []. The patient had limitation of jaw movements and mouth opening was only 15 mm []. There were no other bony or soft tissue injuries noticed during examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, which showed a hematoma within the temporalis muscle []. Thus, a diagnosis was established as hematoma and the patient was taken up for surgical evacuation of hematoma. Intraoperatively, a mouth opening of 40 mm was achieved and the patient was discharged on the sixth postoperative day with some muscle relaxants and advised forceful mouth opening physiotherapy. At the time of discharge, the patient's mouth opening was 30 mm and review on the first, third and sixth week postoperatively showed that there was recurrence of trismus, which was progressive and the patient's mouth opening was limited to 2 mm [].\nA computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed calcified masses within temporalis muscle suggestive of extraskeletal bone formation []. A provisional diagnosis of MOT was established and the patient was taken for surgery with a treatment plan of excision of calcified masses and coronoidectomy. Intraoperatively, flakes of calcified masses were removed along with a part of temporalis muscle and ipsilateral coronoidectomy was performed. Intraoperative mouth opening of 38 mm was achieved and postoperatively forceful mouth opening physiotherapy was advised along with muscle relaxants. The excised tissue was sent for histopathological examination, which showed muscle fiber bundles"}
{"note": "A 40-year-old African American, morbidly obese female patient was referred to our service for evaluation of left buttock mass (). She reported minor discomfort and she did not tolerate sitting down for long periods of time. She described that the mass had been growing slowly for the past six months. She described no urinary, rectal, or gynecological symptoms. She had no prior surgeries. On physical examination there was a bulging mass on the left lateral wall of the vagina without any direct invasion; the rectum had a normal tone with displacement of the left lateral wall towards the midline; the left perineal area revealed a 25 × 14 cm soft mass.\nEndoscopic ultrasound demonstrated a demarcated fat plane between the rectum and the mass. However, the CT scan found no clear fat plane between the mass and the surrounding structures. Imaging revealed the mass within the subcutaneous tissue of the left perirectal region, displacing the anal canal to the right and displacing superiorly the levator ani musculature. Uterine leiomyomas and diverticulosis were found incidentally. The MRI dimensions of the mass were 23 × 8 × 11 cm and showed no muscular or osseous invasion, with well-defined walls and considerable enhancement with a preliminary diagnosis of a pedunculated leiomyoma; however, a soft tissue sarcoma could not be ruled out (). There was concern that this tumor was directly invading the surrounding structures, such as the rectum, vagina, anal sphincter, or adnexa. On the basis of the results of the imaging studies, a large leiomyoma was suspected, but we could not rule out a low grade soft tissue sarcoma. Surgical resection was performed and no direct extension into surrounding structures was found; muscle fibers of the anal sphincter were densely adherent to the tumor and were divided close to the tumor in order to preserve function. After the surgery the patient had no anal dysfunction and she was discharged just with pain medication. She denied fecal incontinence or dyspareunia. After two-year followup she remains without recurrence."}
{"note": "A 45-year-old female with accidental flame burns of the chest and upper limbs (approximately 30%) was referred from another hospital with high fever and breathlessness requiring Ventilatory support. She was primarily treated there for superficial burns, during which time a right internal jugular vein catheter was inserted in the intensive care unit (ICU) for administration of drugs and volume. Five days after insertion of the CVC, the patient developed high fever and, over the next 7 days, breathing difficulty, this was interpreted as sepsis and supported by laboratory investigation and growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the blood sample. Appropriate antibiotics were administered and the patient showed no clinical improvement despite 3 weeks of antibiotic treatment. She persistently recorded high temperatures and was breathless even at rest. She was referred in this status to our hospital and was put on respirator for poor blood gas values. Further evaluation of sepsis with transthoracic echocardiogram showed large vegetation, measuring approximately 3 cm, on the anterior tricuspid leaflet (ATL) with no tricuspid regurgitation. Other cardiac valves were normal. Trans-oesophageal echocardiogram confirmed the findings []. The patient had to be ventilated for respiratory decompensation secondary to showering of the pulmonary circuit by tiny vegetations on the ATL and was taken for surgery immediately. Through a standard median sternotomy, the heart was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and the tricuspid valve was approached through the right atrium after cardioplegic arrest. Large vegetation was seen occupying almost half of the anterior tricuspid leaflet [], and the vegetation seemed to travel down the chordal apparatus as well. Other leaflets of the tricuspid valve and the pulmonary valve were normal. Total vegetectomy was performed with curettage of the anterior tricuspid leaflet and the remaining defect in the ATL [] was repaired with a piece of native pericardium. Because the patient was culture positive for MRSA, a prosthetic ring was not placed and the patient weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass with minimal support. She was afebrile the next day of surgery and remained so"}
{"note": "A four-year-old female child presented to us with complaints of dysphagia and regurgitation of solid food. A contrast-enhanced CT scan (CECT) of the chest done elsewhere revealed an aberrant right subclavian artery []. A 256 slice CECT scan was ordered in our hospital for the exact anatomical characterization of the aberrant vessel. The scan showed an aberrant origin of the right subclavian artery from the medial wall of the descending thoracic aorta, just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery [Figures and ]. The artery crossed to the right side at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra, causing posterior compression of the esophagus. An additional finding that was noted was the common origin of the right and left common carotid arteries. The arch was left-sided, with a left descending thoracic aorta. An echocardiogram done showed a large ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) of 20 mm, with a dilated right atrium and right ventricle.\nUnder general anesthesia a median sternotomy was performed. The arch was followed down from the top and the aberrant right subclavian artery was identified just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery on the medial wall of the descending thoracic aorta. Loss of the right radial artery trace on clamping the aberrant vessel confirmed that the vessel was indeed the right subclavian artery. The artery was carefully divided at its site of origin and the aortic end oversewn with two layers of continuous polypropylene sutures. The artery was next brought to the right side from behind the esophagus and the anastomosed end side to the right common carotid artery, after confirming that there was no torsion of the mobilized vessel []. Pericardial patch closure of the ostium secundum ASD was performed in a routine manner, under cardiopulmonary bypass, under mild hypothermia using the standard cannulation techniques. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on day six from the hospital. The patient had no complaints of dysphagia or regurgitation of food on discharge."}

She felt pain while walking and while standing up from squatting position. The patient gave no history of locking episodes. On clinical examination, there was no obvious swelling over her left knee. There was no tenderness around the knee except for tenderness over the medial joint line. The patient complained of pain during terminal flexion. There was no laxity in the knee. McMurray test was positive for the medial meniscus. Rest of the examination of the knee was unremarkable.\nThe patient had already been treated with physiotherapy and occasional analgesics. We decided to image the left knee. The radiographs of the knee revealed no abnormality (). We performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the knee and expected it to show a medial meniscal tear. Initial reporting by the radiologist confirmed a medial meniscal tear without a mention of it being discoid. However, because the body of the meniscus was seen in 4 consecutive sagittal sections of the MRI scan ( and ), we suspected a discoid medial meniscus and got the scan reported again. This time, the radiologist reported it as a torn discoid medial meniscus. We decided to perform arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and meniscoplasty for the patient.\nArthroscopy confirmed a discoid medial meniscus occupying the entire medial tibial plateau (). The anterior part of the discoid meniscus was attached along the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) (). However, no obvious tear could be visualized (). We then trimmed the lateral edge of the meniscus lying toward the intercondylar region which revealed a large cleavage tear completely restricted to the interstitial part (). We resected the upper and lower flaps till a stable peripheral semilunar rim of meniscus was obtained (). Postoperatively, the patient was started on a physiotherapy protocol to preserve range of motion and muscle strength. Weight bearing was started after pain due to"}

The patient gave a history of extraction of teeth in the same region one year before. On examination, a diffuse mild extra oral swelling was present on the right cheek, with proptosis and watery discharge from the right eye (). On palpation, extraorally the swelling was mildly tender and discontinuity was felt on the right infra orbital margin. Intraoral examination revealed a soft well defined ulcerated growth on the right maxillary edentulous alveolar ridge, extending from the right maxillary first molar region to the maxillary tuberosity region posteriorly. The surface of the growth was covered with a yellowish necrotic material. It was slightly tender on palpation ().\nThe clinical differential diagnosis included the most common malignancies in the oral cavity such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), minor salivary gland tumor, and carcinoma of the maxillary sinus. Panoramic radiograph revealed severe bone destruction of the right maxilla distal to the canine. The floor of the right maxillary sinus was also destroyed. Computed tomography (CT) scan was performed and sections were taken in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. Coronal section revealed a large soft tissue density lesion with its epicentre in the maxillary sinus, causing destruction of all walls of the maxillary sinus, extending medially into the lateral wall of the nasal septum, left nasal cavity involving the inferior and middle turbinates, laterally into the pterygopalatine fossa, superiorly into the orbit, inferiorly causing destruction of the hard palate and alveolar processes of the right maxilla in the molar region. There was no evidence of calcification (). Three dimensional CT reconstructions using the bone and soft tissue settings demonstrated a large lytic lesion in the right maxillary sinus destroying all walls of the maxillary sinus, hard palate, and alveolar process in the molar region ( and ).\nThe patient was advised to undergo routine"}
{"note": "A 55-year-old man was admitted with progressing dysphagia and dyspnea. He had been diagnosed with aortic arch aneurysm 4 years earlier. At that time, a computed tomography (CT) scan had demonstrated a huge aortic arch aneurysm with a maximal diameter of about 6.8 cm (). However, he had refused further treatment at the time. On arrival, a chest radiograph revealed marked aneurysmal dilatation of the entire arch (). On the follow-up CT scan, the size of the aneurysm had increased up to a maximal diameter about 9 cm and the trachea was nearly collapsed and deviated into the right side (). The proximal descending aorta was also involved down to the level of the 7th thoracic vertebra. The patient was also diagnosed with single vessel disease by coronary angiography performed for preoperative evaluation. Therefore, we planned total arch replacement and a coronary arterial bypass graft.\nGeneral anesthesia was administered and a double-lumen endotracheal tube was used to permit deflation of the left lung during the distal anastomosis. The patient was maintained in a supine position with the left chest elevated by about 30 degrees. Initially, the right axillary artery and left femoral artery were exposed for cardiopulmonary bypass. After exposure of the right axillary artery and left femoral artery, an L-shaped skin incision was made through an upper partial sternotomy and left anterior thoracotomy along the 5th intercostal space (). Thereafter, the left internal thoracic artery was harvested for coronary arterial bypass grafting in a skeletonized fashion. After exposure of the innominate artery and left common carotid artery, the left subclavian artery was exposed through a small left supraclavicular incision to the neck because the left subclavian artery was seated deeply and deviated upwards. After systemic heparinization, arterial cannulae in each artery for systemic circulation were inserted through the right axillary and left femoral artery with Seldinger's technique. Venous drainage was performed through a single two-stage cannula inserted into the right atrial appendage. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established and a left ventricular vent catheter was"}

The pain was colicky and started gradually without any bowel motion or flatus for two days. The drug and family history was unremarkable. Patient had tachycardia, with normal blood pressure and oxygen saturation of 100 % in room air. The abdomen was found to be distended and tender all over with an empty rectum by digital rectal examination (DRE). Upright chest and abdominal X-ray showed multiple air fluid levels with no air under the diaphragm (). CT abdomen showed a dilated proximal small bowel loop and a picture of SBO at distal ileal loops (). The patient resuscitated with intravenous (IV) fluids and kept nil per os (NPO). A nasogastric tube was inserted, and the patient was shifted to the operating room. Laparoscopic exploration showed dilated small bowel loops with collapsed distal ileum and an inflammatory band was found 20 cm from ileocecal junction originating from a small bowel diverticulum with no palpable intraluminal masses (). The inflammatory band was present at the distal part of the diverticulum and was adhered to a small bowel segment leading to obstruction. The band was released, and wedge resection of the diverticulum was performed at its base by gastrointestinal anastomosis (GIA) on healthy tissue, about 2 cm from the inflamed segment, which is a standard surgical approach for MD. The postoperative period was uneventful. The patient was initially kept at regular surgical floor bed and then discharged on the second postoperative day, when he passed good bowel motion. The histopathology result on follow up visit showed MD with Schistosoma infection, most likely by Schistosoma mansoni. The patient was referred afterwards to the infectious disease department for initiation of praziquantel, which is the drug of choice for schistosomiasis and is effective against all Schistosoma species.

The patient was admitted to our hospital without any major symptoms. An initial DSA image demonstrated dilatation at the fourth segment of the left VA, thus indicating a VADA without the involvement of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) (). The right vertebral and basilar artery showed no major abnormalities. He had a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but no previously reported head trauma and family history of aneurysm. The patient had a history of smoking 20 cigarettes a day for 20 years, which was ceased just at the time of this admission.\nWe treated the left VADA using endovascular pipeline embolization for preserving the normal blood flow. In addition, a dual antiplatelet therapy, comprising 300 mg aspirin and 300 mg clopidogrel were administered 5 days before the surgery. Under general anesthesia, a pipeline embolization device (PED) was successfully implanted with satisfactory adherence between the PED and vessel wall. No intraoperative complications were encountered, and the right VA was preserved. He was discharged home 1 week after the operation and prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 100 mg/day and clopidogrel l00 mg/ day) for 6 months. Angiography conducted at 5 months after initial treatment revealed the patency of the VA and partial aneurysm residues (). This residual of the left VADA persisted on 14 months () and 2 years (), and completely occluded at 3 years angiography follow-up ().

Since two years, periodic swelling occurred every other month and remained present for several days to weeks. Consumption of acid fluids was painful. No fever was noted. During earlier acute phases, antibiotics had been administered twice, with a positive effect on the duration of the symptoms. Earlier ultrasound examination, dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and sialography at the time of the swelling did not reveal any abnormalities, although his parents reported that he remained without symptoms for three months after the sialography, which was longer than normal. Medical and family history revealed no relevant facts, especially no history of autoimmune disease. The boy was vaccinated according to the Dutch vaccination program.\nBecause of the frequent and recurrent character of the symptoms, the parents were seeking a second opinion after an earlier diagnosis of chronic recurrent parotitis. When he presented at the outpatient clinic, swelling and pain of the right jaw region had been present for one month ().\nPhysical examination did not reveal abnormalities in the mouth and ears, except for the fact that he was not able to fully open his mouth (trismus). There were no signs of infection, periodontitis, caries or purulent saliva discharge in the mouth. Blood analysis showed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and a normal amylase. The first echography performed during complaints showed lymphadenitis, without parotitis, while a second echography, also during complaints, showed a parotitis. The results of the examinations are listed in . As not all examinations were compatible with parotitis, and as there was no explanation for the fact that the boy was unable to fully open his mouth, a new MRI of the jaw was performed.

A well-defined, ovoid, multilobular swelling of size 8 cm × 9 cm with superioinferior extent from left zygomatic arch to about 4 cm below the lower border of the mandible and anteroposterior from the anterior border of masseter to 1 cm beyond posterior border of mandible was noted. The left ear lobule was slightly raised and everted []. Facial and eye movements were normal on examination. Intraoral examination reveals a nonhealing suspicious ulcer over the left posterior buccal mucosa distal to second molar of size 1 cm × 1 cm. Clinically there were no neck nodes. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the extraoral swelling was done, which was suggestive of a benign mixed tumor. Incisional biopsy was performed for intraoral lesion, which was suggestive of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) [].\nAfter obtaining presurgical workup and written informed consent, surgery was planned. The skin incision was given over the prominent part of tumor to remove the excess skin paddle, which was extended to the lower part and tunneled to perform supraomohyoid neck dissection in the same sitting.

Six days before the hospital visit, the patient experienced numbness in the right upper limb and instability while holding without obvious incentive but did not seek immediate medical intervention. Three days before admission, the patient experienced convulsive seizure in the right upper limb while remaining conscious, which was relieved after 1 min. Similar attacks occurred intermittently on six further occasions. The patient had a 3-year history of hypertension with the highest blood pressure being 180/110 mmHg. He also had a history of smoking and drinking lasting more than 30 years. He was born and has always lived in Beijing, with no history of contact with infested water, infectious zone, other radioactive substances or toxins. Upon admission, the patient was examined to be obese with no subcutaneous nodules. Neurological examinations showed full level muscle strength in the right upper limb, accompanied with diminished needling response. Emergency head CT scan (2016-1-1) showed lower density in the left parietal lobe. As the patient manifested as an acute onset of right limb weakness and hemiparesis,with low density lesions in the left occipital lobe on CT and a history of hypertension, the patient was hospitalised with a preliminary diagnosis of acute stroke and secondary epilepsy.\nAfter hospitalisation, head MRI scan (2016-1-4) displayed a lesion in the left parietal lobe of unknown nature. After enhancement in the magnetic field, a larger area of oedema was found around the lesion in the left parietal lobe which could indicate glioma or other inflammatory diseases. Since the nature of the brain lesion did not match the characteristics of common cerebrovascular diseases, intracranial angiography DSA was used but found no obvious vascular abnormalities or stenosis.

He had a known background of a stable middle ear mass for which he was observed for 3 years at a different institution. He was otherwise fit and healthy with no comorbid illnesses or regular medications. Examination findings were consistent with an inflammatory middle ear effusion with a bulging tympanic membrane associated with right sided facial nerve palsy. Tuning fork tests demonstrated a conductive hearing loss in the affected ear. All other cranial nerves were intact. The patient was admitted under ENT for intravenous antibiotics and steroids. Within 72 hours of antibiotics administration, the otalgia subsided with improving facial nerve movement as well. He was discharged on oral antibiotics with follow-up in our outpatient department. With resolution of his middle ear infection, a pale red-pink mass was visible behind the tympanic membrane.\nFurther imaging demonstrated a middle ear mass with partial disruption of the facial canal. A subsequent angiogram demonstrated an avascular middle ear mass. Mixed hearing loss was demonstrated in the right ear on audiogram. The patient was electively taken to the operating theatre for a middle ear exploration and mastoidectomy with the intention of confirming the nature of the tumour and performing a subtotal removal. Intraoperative frozen section raised the possibility of a neuroendocrine tumour. The patient was successfully discharged on postoperative day 1. At 2 months follow-up postoperative hearing was preserved with normal facial nerve function and no evidence of recurrence.\nExamination of histological sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin revealed small fragments of mucosa with underlying pieces of vital bone. The mucosa was surfaced by nonkeratinising stratified squamous epithelium which showed no epithelial dysplasia with no evidence of surface origin of the tumour.

Furthermore, the blood from abdominal paracentesis demonstrated intra-abdominal hemorrhage. The left femoral pulse and the distal pulses were palpable, with no further attention paid to the left lower limb. An emergency exploratory laparotomy under combined spinal and epidural anesthesia was performed. About 1450 mL blood was sucked from the abdomen and the mesentery of the ileum where the bleeding was located. Hemostasis was achieved with suturing and ligation. After the surgery, the patient felt numbness and coolness below the level of his left knee, but the surgeon thought it was due to the effect of the anesthesia and no pulse examination was performed.\nThe patient was transferred to our unit after 32 h from the accident and presented with severe numbness and impaired motor function of the left lower limb. The complete examination of his leg showed the absence of the left femoral pulse and the distal pulses, together with calf muscle weakness and diminished sensation of the entire foot. Subsequently, computed tomography (CT) angiogram revealed that the left common iliac artery was occluded (). This patient was immediately sent to the operation room. A femorofemoral artery bypass was established at the common iliac artery. The postoperative physical examination revealed a palpable pulse and warm skin. Postoperative Doppler ultrasound demonstrated the presence of blood flow.\nUnfortunately, severe pain and significantly progressive swelling occurred on the second day after revascularization.

Her white cell count was elevated but all other blood tests including electrolytes, renal function, bilirubin and liver function tests were normal. A CT scan with oral gastrograffin contrast showed a midline abdominal hernia with small bowel loops, and a parastomal hernia containing an enlarged, thick-walled mass which did not contain oral contrast (Fig. ). With close proximity to the liver and absence of the gallbladder from its anatomical position, a gallbladder hernia was suspected. The alternative diagnosis of herniation of small bowel was considered, but with lack of oral contrast within the hernia, it was considered less likely.\nAt operation on the same day, a urinary catheter was placed in the stoma, and a midline laparotomy was performed. Following dissection and reduction of the midline abdominal hernia, the parastomal defect was defined (Fig. ). A 14 gauge needle was used to drain the hernia contents of which bile was extracted, confirming the presence of the gallbladder in the hernia (Fig. ). The gallbladder was then able to be reduced, and noted to be acalculous but thick walled and oedematous (Fig. ). A cholecystectomy was performed. The large remaining parastomal defect was not closed to"}

Physical examination revealed an increased second heart sound with an associated gallop rhythm and a diastolic murmur heard best at the cardiac apex. Radial pulses were normal but the femoral pulses were weak. Blood pressure measured at the left arm was higher than the one measured at the left leg. Chest X-ray showed rib notching and cardiomegaly (Figure ). Further evaluation with echocardiography revealed an aortic root dilatation of 42 mm with ascending aorta dilatation 68 mm and concomitant severe aortic valve insufficiency (3+). The left ventricle was dilated with end diastolic diameter 75 mm and associated systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 35 percent. Pulmonary hypertension 60 to 25 mean 40 mm Hg was also present. Thoracic CT scanning with intravenous contrast medium showed an ascending aorta aneurysm of 68 mm (Figure ).\nCardiac catheterization was performed showing normal coronary arteries and severe aortic coarctation with a 70 mm Hg gradient measured across the descending aorta. The minimum diameter of the stenotic region on the aorta was 2 mm. The patient was classified as functional class III according to NYHA.\nCorrection of aortic coarctation was performed first by using a less invasive method. After heparinization and administration of antibiotic prophylaxis, dilatation across the coarctation site with balloon angioplasty was performed. Dilatation was accomplished by using 3 consecutive catheters of increasing size (8, 12, and 15 mm in diameter respectively). Post-dilatation aortography showed no residual gradients and the stenotic region was increased to 15 mm in diameter. The procedure was uncomplicated and the patient was released the following day.\nTwo weeks after balloon angioplasty the patient was re-admitted for management of the intracardiac pathology. Pre-operational thoracic CT scanning was performed to exclude any post-dilatational aneurysm formation at the site of balloon anchorage and determine descending aorta diameter (Figure ). Arterial cannulation at the right axillary artery was performed using a synthetic PTFE 8 mm graft. The purpose of this was twofold;"}

The pain was described as constant, sharp, radiated to her back, and associated with episodes of vomiting after a few hours. Similar episodes of pain were experienced in the previous few months and diagnosed as a case of bilateral dermoid in another hospital but the case was not documented. These episodes of pain were, however, shorter in duration and resolved spontaneously. She was otherwise well and there were no other associated gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptoms. She had no previous history of any illnesses or allergies. She denied the use of any medications. She had one pregnancy, usual course, and delivered normal spontaneous vaginal delivery. There was no family history of malignancies. There was no significant family or psychosocial history. Her menarche commenced at the age of 11 years with subsequent regular cycles.\nOn physical examination, she was alert, in mild distress, and her vital signs were within normal limits. An abdominal examination showed lower abdominal tenderness, with muscle guarding to palpation but there was no distension. Intestinal sounds were normal. An external genital examination was normal. A pelvic examination revealed bilateral adnexal tenderness on vaginal touch. Her full blood counts, serum biochemistry, and tumor marker were within the normal ranges. Urine analysis and pregnancy test were negative.\nAn ultrasound examination was performed bedside demonstrating bilateral ovarian cystic masses, on the left side around 14 × 11 cm and right side 8 × 6 cm with negative Doppler flow in the ovarian tissue with evidence of solid components. On the basis of these findings, ovarian torsion caused by adnexal mass was the likely diagnosis. Our patient was counselled and signed informed consent for laparoscopic ovarian detorsion, cystectomy, possible oophorectomy, and laparotomy if needed.\nIntraoperative findings confirmed a bilateral ovarian torsion that was the same size as that found by ultrasound.

His symptoms began 3 months prior, after falling onto the ulnar aspect of his hand. The patient had been evaluated at the time of injury in the emergency department and subsequently at an urgent care facility where the correct diagnosis remained unidentified despite obtaining the radiographic images shown in (, ).\n3 months after his initial injury, the patient presented to the senior author’s office with the primary complaint of persistent pain at the base of his fifth metacarpal. He also noted that his small finger would get caught outside his pocket when retrieving an item. On physical examination of the left hand, a slight small finger abduction deformity was noted throughout digital range of motion. There was tenderness to palpation over the base of the metacarpal and no signs of neurological or vascular impairment. Posteroanterior (PA), lateral, and oblique radiographs reviewed from the time of injury and those taken at the time of presentation demonstrated a dislocation of the fifth metacarpal base in a volar and ulnar direction.\nThe decision was made with the patient to proceed with operative reduction and fixation of his chronic injury. A longitudinal incision was made along the dorsal aspect of the fifth metacarpal. The extensor tendons were protected and retracted. Surrounding intrinsic musculature and fibrous tissue were released from the metacarpal allowing visualization of the CMC joint. Successful reduction was accomplished with axial traction and manual pressure applied in a palmar to dorsal direction at the base of the metacarpal. An appropriate reduction was fluoroscopically confirmed at the metacarpal base, and the abduction deformity was reduced. The fifth metacarpal was then stabilized with parallel Kirschner wires to the fourth metacarpal distally and proximally. The reduction was confirmed and supported with an additional Kirschner wire driven retrograde through the CMC joint into the hamate ().\nThe patient was immobilized in an ulnar gutter splint and pins"}

As she was detected with hypertension at her first visit, we recommended that she check her blood pressure regularly at home. She developed fever, oral ulcers, and arthralgia at 16 weeks of gestation, due to which a relapse of Behçet disease was suspected. Because her condition was controlled well with PSL, the daily oral dose of PSL was increased from 8 mg to 10 mg. At this time, ulceration and pain of the vulva were not observed. She visited our outpatient clinic for a regular prenatal examination at 18 weeks and 4 days of gestation, which was when an ulcer localized in the vagina was incidentally observed ().

He was a software engineer, and his dominant hand was the right hand. Physical examination revealed complete loss of active extension and also that passive extension and active flexion of the IP joint were full. The IP joint was stable against radial and ulnar stress. The images of plain radiography and computed tomography showed an avulsion fracture of one-third to half of its articular surface at the base of the distal phalanx (). Using the hook plate technique, open reduction was performed under general anesthesia 19 days after the injury (). An incision was made along the crease on the dorsal side of the IP joint. The fracture was reduced and fixed using a hook plate adapted from a 1.5 mm micro module (KLS Martin, Germany, ). One of the holes was cut, and one-third of its circumference was removed. The ends of the crescent arc were bent approximately 100° by pliers to form two sharp pointed hooks (). Two small longitudinal incisions were made at the EPL. The hook plate was slid under the nail matrix, the hooks were inserted through the slips, and the bone fragment was gripped. The screw was inserted into the plate hole to add compression to the fragment. The articular congruency and stability of the fragment in the direction of passive flexion were checked, and the wound was closed.\nThe splint was maintained for 1 week before motion of the IP joint was allowed, and the patient returned to work 1 day after surgery. Bone union was achieved and the plate was removed 3 months after the procedure ().

Computed tomographic angiography performed 3 years prior had revealed that the left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery were totally occluded along with a thrombotic aneurysm 5.8 × 5.2 × 9.6 cm in size (). She also had a localized dissection in the low abdominal aorta and focal stenosis in the descending aorta as well as a large left coronary aneurysm and about 50% stenosis of the right coronary artery. Plain chest radiographs revealed a huge superior mediastinal mass which was suspected of an aneurysm with thrombus in the left subclavian artery (). Cardiac single photon emission computed tomography and echocardiography were performed preoperatively to follow up on her coronary artery statuses. These examinations showed an old myocardial infarct, a persistent perfusion defect in the basal inferior wall and a reduction in wall motion.\nThe patient had been diagnosed with Type III TA as determined by the involvement of the aortic arch and coronary artery as well as the descending thoracic and abdominal aortas.

He had received blood transfusions at two instances to control the severe anemia. The patient reported that, since childhood, he had blue spots, similar to varicose veins, distributed in his hands, arms, legs, and trunk that increased in size and number with his age. The lesions had varying diameters (1 cm to 12 cm) and were usually regularly raised mushrooms, resembling small bubbles of blue coloration (). One of these skin lesions was located at the elbow and had demonstrated several episodes of bleeding after trauma; it had been excised and sent for examination. The histopathological examination of this lesion confirmed the diagnosis of cutaneous hemangioma. Upon physical examination, the patient was in a good general condition with severe mucocutaneous pallor. The examination of the skin on the body's surface showed numerous injuries resembling raised mushrooms with soft consistency and depressive compression that most often involved the trunk and upper limbs.

The tumor gradually enlarged to 2 cm in diameter in two years and was associated with local erythematous change. An excision biopsy was performed by a general surgeon in a medical center. Histopathological examination revealed a nodular neoplastic lesion composed of spindle-shaped cells with frequent mitotic figures. Immunohistochemical stain was negative for actin but positive for CD34. Thin collagen fibers crisscrossing between the spindle cells stained positive with Masson trichrome. The pathological diagnosis was consistent with DFSP. Due to the close proximity of surgical margins to the tumor mass and the characterized highly recurrent nature locally of the tumor, a wider excision was strongly suggested by the general surgeon. The pilot visited the plastic surgery outpatient clinics in another hospital 3 weeks later for a second opinion. A wide excision and split-thickness skin graft with donor from left palm hypothenar region were done. Width of the surgical margin was not mentioned in the medical record. A pathology report revealed residual DFSP in the lower dermis and subcutis region of the skin surrounding the previous wound. Two weeks after his second surgery, he was admitted to the previously-mentioned medical center where a plastic surgeon carried out a wide excision of the skin and soft tissue around the previous wound. About 1 cm margin around the lesion was excised. The depth of the defect was 0.5 cm, subcutaneous tissue was involved, but tendons were spared.

It showed a spinal vascular malformation with a large aneurysm at the level of the lower thoracic spinal cord, causing massive compression of the lumbar spinal cord. The boy was transferred to our university hospital for further diagnosis. Spinal angiography (under general anaesthesia) identified the vascular malformation as a spinal arteriovenous fistula with an associated large venous aneurysm at the level of the fistula. The dilated arterial feeder as recognized from MRI originated from the intercostal artery at T9. It was thought to be a single fistula. Due to the low weight of the boy, only a limited amount of contrast could be administered and more distal thoracic levels were not checked. An embolisation of this AVF at T9 was carried out, using a coil and a liquid embolic agent (). The idea was that the aneurysm would gradually shrink in time, whereas initial aneurysm occlusion would result in an oedematous reaction with increase in spinal cord compression. Postoperative high-dose dexamethasone was given to prevent oedema of the spinal cord. The boy recovered well with spontaneous movements of the lower limbs and preservation of sensibility. Because of his symptoms and"}
{"note": "A 27 -years old male sustained transverse fracture of the patella with gross displacement while playing football. The fracture was subsequently stabilized with tension band wiring with two Kirschner wires (K-wire) & figure of eight stainless steel wire. The immediate post operative period was uneventful. He was discharged after stitch removal with knee support and was advised partial weight bearing with knee bending exercises in between. However, he indulged in heavy manual work including bicycling after 15 days of surgery. This led to loosening of implants and failure of reduction. He reported after 2 months of failure with pain, swelling and stiffness of the knee joint. X-rays revealed wide displacement of the fragments with loose implants ().\nThe options for such a case were either patellectomy or apposing the fragments by some means. Patellectomy would lead to difficulty in apposing the ligaments as there were gross displacements of the fragments leading to contracture of soft tissues on either side of the patella. Apposing the fragments would require extensive soft tissue dissection and lengthening of the quadriceps tendon resulting in extensive scarring and stiffness. As we were accumulating experience by using Ilizarov in various situations, we opted for it to mend the difficult situation in this case. We felt gradual docking with slow stretching of the soft tissue without any dissection would be the perfect choice for the case. After removing the implants, the fracture margins were cleared of fibrous tissue taking care not to remove any bone. As acute docking was not possible, sub-acute docking was contemplated on the table. Opposing olive wires, 2 in number on either fragments (total 4 in number), attached to traction units were passed through the fragments which were mounted on two full rings on either side (joining two half rings). The rings were fixed to distal femur and proximal tibia by wires and interconnected with threaded rods. The fragments were brought together as close as possible on the table by turning the nuts on the traction units (sub-acute"}

He was overactive and aggressive, hitting and biting others. His sleep was disturbed.\nHe has been well until 2 months ago, at which time he refused to go to school citing somatic symptoms. He later reported being physically punished by a school teacher which appeared to have led to the school refusal. During this period, he was irritable and anxious. He reported suicidal ideation and threatened to jump into their well on one occasion, following an argument with his mother. He was socially withdrawn. His sleep was disturbed and he had poor appetite. He was diagnosed as having a depressive episode and commenced on sertraline 25 mg mane 3 weeks prior to the current presentation. His father reported some improvement with this in terms of his activity and dose was increased to 50 mg 2 weeks later. After about 5 days, he became very disturbed, attempting to run off. His father brought him to the hospital as they could not safely contain him at home.\nHe was the older of 2 siblings and lived with his parents and younger sister. There was a family history of bipolar affective disorder in one of his first cousins. His parents were supportive, but there were marital conflicts and he reported witnessing domestic violence between them. His birth and development history were normal and past medical and psychiatric history were unremarkable. His school performance has been average. Although his parents reported him as being hyperactive and stubborn, his school teachers claimed he was a well-behaved child who could concentrate and completed the tasks he was given. There was evidence of inconsistent parenting styles with his father being authoritarian and mother being very permissive.\nOn mental state examination, he was an average built boy dressed casually. During the initial interview, he attempted to run off and was restrained physically by his father."}

He was diagnosed with septic shock and, thereafter, admitted to the intensive care unit and intubated. Non-contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen revealed hematoma in the right renal pelvis and bladder (Fig. ). In parallel with intensive care, bladder hematoma was cleared, and continuous bladder irrigation commenced. He had a history of rectal cancer and received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by low anterior resection 12 years before the presentation. He developed acute renal failure due to bilateral ureteral strictures presumably caused by radiation 8 years before the presentation. Subsequently, he underwent bilateral ureteral stenting and regularly visited our hospital for stent exchange every 3 months. Ten days after the admission, he developed hemorrhagic shock due to a sudden massive gross hematuria. On suspicion of a right UAF, emergency angiography was performed; however, it was not able to identify the source of bleeding. Prophylactic embolization of the right renal artery was executed on an equivocal suspicion of renal hemorrhage. Eighteen days after the admission, he again developed hemorrhagic shock due to a sudden massive gross hematuria for the second time. However, contrast-enhanced CT and angiography could not identify the source of bleeding either. He underwent prophylactic right nephrectomy. Severe adhesion due to prior abdominal surgery, inflammation, and radiotherapy resulted in major bleeding and precluded dissection of the right distal ureter. Twenty-eight days after the admission, he developed hemorrhagic shock for the same massive gross hematuria again for the third time. Contrast-enhanced CT suggested a small pseudoaneurysm in the right external iliac artery at the iliac-ureteral crossover. Based on UAF diagnosis, he underwent emergency angiography and endovascular treatment. Under local anesthesia, the 4-Fr angiographic sheath was inserted via the left femoral artery. An angled guidewire and angiographic catheter were advanced across the aortic bifurcation into the right common iliac artery. UAF was confirmed by angiograms. Coil embolization of the right proximal internal iliac artery was performed to secure an"}
{"note": "A 27-year-old female patient was admitted to our gastroenterology clinic with complaints of abdominal pain and diarrhea of more than 3 months duration. The colonoscopic exam revealed inflammatory changes of the colonic mucosa suggesting inflammatory bowel disease. The computerized tomography showed a solid lesion measuring 2 cm in the left ovary in addition to dilatation of the small bowel segments. Hence, the patient was diagnosed as Crohn's disease and medication with salofalk and steroid treatment was introduced to treat the acute inflammatory attack. However, during her hospitalization period, she began to display progressive nausea and vomiting, suggesting that a small bowel obstruction had developed due to a stricture as a complication of the Crohn's disease. After consultation with the general surgery department on the patient's ileus, it was decided to perform an explorative laparotomy. The patient was explored and dilated small bowel segments, which ended 10 cm proximal to the cecum because a stricture was found (). Multiple lymph nodes with a slightly thickened mesoperitoneum at the strictured ileal segment were palpated. Furthermore, an endometrial cyst 2 cm in diameter, originating from the left ovary, was also detected. The strictured ileal segment was resected and end-ileostomy was performed. Anastomosis was avoided because of the excessive dilatation of the proximal part of the ileum and suspicion of an inflammatory bowel which carries high risk for anastomotic leakage. The endometrial cyst was aspirated and a biopsy was taken from the cyst wall. Macroscopic examination of the resection specimen revealed dilated areas with normal bowel thickness and other areas that are firm and thickened. Microscopic examination revealed nests of endometriotic glands and stroma lying in the muscularis propria with regional lymph node involvement (Figures and ). The overlying mucosa was intact. Both endometrial epithelial and stromal cells were positive for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) within ileal wall and lymph nodes (Figures and ). Stromal cells were also immunohistochemically CD10 positive. The histology of the ovarian cyst also showed endometriosis with endometriotic surface epithelial lining"}
{"note": "A 62-year-old male presented with painless gross hematuria for 2 years. The patient reported hematuria after activity including exercise and sexual intercourse. Cystoscopy was performed by the referring urologist, which revealed a bladder mass in the left anterior wall of the bladder. Biopsies were obtained by the referring urologist, with equivocal pathology analysis revealing atypia. The patient denied any pelvic pain, flank pain, or dysuria. He denied any unintentional weight loss, fevers, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, neurologic deficits, headaches, or gastrointestinal disturbances. The patient was eventually referred to us for further evaluation and definitive treatment of the bladder mass.\nThe patient had no significant medical history, except remote history of left inguinal hernia surgery at 3 months of age and a left open inguinal hernia repair with mesh at age 47. There were no prior operative reports available to determine which type of mesh had been used for these repairs. There were no pertinent findings on physical examination. All laboratories, including a complete metabolic panel and a complete blood count, were within normal limits. The patient had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis that showed a mass on the left anterior bladder wall ( and ).\nGiven the concern for malignancy and severity of symptoms, the patient ultimately underwent blue light cystoscopy and was found to have a large lesion in the left dome of the bladder. The lesion had a blackened appearance and was found to be blue light negative ( and ). Closer inspection of the lesion revealed the lattice meshwork, suggestive of an eroded mesh plug. Multiple biopsies were taken to rule out any associated malignancy. The final pathology analysis revealed surgical material consistent with the mesh, as well as benign urothelial mucosa with squamous metaplasia.\nWe discussed the treatment options with the patient, including the rationale for excision, and the patient opted to proceed with surgery.

The onset of swelling was associated with fever. It was initially of pea size and rapidly increased to the size of a marble, over a period of 1 month. It was not associated with pain or discomfort.\nOn extra-oral examination, the mass measured 3 × 3 cm and was located at the junction of middle and lower third of the face, 2 cm lateral to the angle of the mouth. The mass was freely movable and no ulceration was observed on the overlying skin. Intra-orally the swelling involved the buccal mucosa at the occlusal plane and extended from the distal aspect of first primary maxillary molar to the distal aspect of permanent maxillary first molar. Bi-digital examination revealed that the swelling was firm in consistency, mobile, and appeared to infiltrate the surrounding soft tissue. The mucosa overlying the swelling was intact. Intraoral examination also revealed dental caries in relation to mandibular left primary second molar.\nAspiration of the swelling did not show any contents. A radiograph of the intra-oral swelling, taken by placing an intra-oral film between the buccal mucosa and the posterior buccal surfaces did not show any radiopacity. Intra-oral periapical radiograph in relation to mandibular left primary second molar revealed deep dental caries involving the pulp. Ultrasonography of the left cheek was carried out. This showed a well demarcated solitary isolated tumor involving the buccal mucosa.\nSurgical excision of the lesion was planned under general anesthesia. Prior to surgery routine blood investigations were carried out. After achieving general anesthesia with oral intubation, infiltration was given over and around the swelling with local anesthetic containing 2% adrenaline.

History of bidi smoking was also present for 10–15 years but he left the habit 5 years ago after the loss of teeth. He was a first-time denture wearer. Intraoral examination revealed completely edentulous arches with severely resorbed lower residual ridge with body prominence in the mid symphyseal region and depressed areas with respect to 36 and 46 region (Figures and ). Medical history did not reveal any significant findings. Fabrication of complete dentures was planned for the patient.\nMaxillary and mandibular complete dentures were fabricated in the conventional manner (). Selective pressure impression technique was used for mandibular final impression and semianatomic posterior teeth were used to reduce the stresses on the edentulous ridge at the time of try-in.\nFollow-up was done after 24 hours of denture insertion and further after 3 weeks and 3 months. Even after 3 months of denture wear with all the instructions followed by the patient, he could not adjust with his new dentures with complains of sore mouth and ulceration along with pain specially in the elevated midline area and depressed 36 and 46 regions although occlusion was satisfactory. Pressure indicating paste was used in 2 consecutive sittings which could provide only temporary relief for few days.

At that time, radiological studies had revealed an intact bony structure with a type III acromion and no tear had been noted in the rotator cuff in the MR images. A standard open anterior acromioplasty was performed under general anesthesia; the surgeon had not mentioned any perioperative complication or signs of any problem during surgery. An aggressive physical therapy protocol had been prescribed, and active and passive free range of motion was allowed immediately after surgery. A month after the operation the patient started complaining of weakness of her shoulder, especially with regard to her ability to abduct her arm. Physical therapy was continued for 3 months following surgery, after which the patient stopped attending the sessions. She consulted specialists at several different institutions and all advised conservative therapy. Conservative therapy continued unsuccessfully until the patient was referred to the senior author's institution for further evaluation.\nAt the time of presentation to the senior author's institution, 1 year after the index operation, the patient complained of excessive pain that awakened her from her sleep and severely limited her daily activities. On physical examination of the right shoulder, an unconventional matured incision scar was visible []. Her right acromion was readily palpable and the bulk of the deltoid muscle could be easily palpated over the superior portion of the arm with attempts at shoulder abduction. The active range of motion (ROM) of the right shoulder was severely limited: active scapular abduction was 50° and both active external and internal rotations were limited to 10° each. Her passive scapular abduction was 120° and passive external and internal rotations were 25° and 20°, respectively.

His past medical history was unremarkable.\nOn observation, a profuse acute venous type bleeding was present at the wound site. The wound was located in the middle of his left axilla. It measured approximately 3 cm in length and was oriented in an anterior–posterior axis. A compressive dressing was applied at the entry point of the stab wound. As a result of refractory hypotension after initial management with vigorous fluidotherapy, he was immediately carried to our operating theatre.\nDuring the course of transportation, it was possible to clinically assess his left upper limb in a summary fashion. Pinprick and light touch sensory examination revealed hypoesthesia of the medial aspect of his arm and forearm from the axillary crease to the palmar wrist crease, as well as of the ulnar side of his hand and of the palmar aspect of the last three digits and of the dorsal aspect of the last two digits (Fig. ). All other areas of his left upper limb showed a normal sensory response.\nA motor examination revealed that he was not able to actively flex the joints of his middle, ring, and little fingers nor to adduct or abduct any of the fingers of his left hand (Fig. ). Moreover, he was not able to adduct his wrist. The remaining motor examination of his left upper limb showed no deficits.\nThe clinical presentation enabled us to promptly locate the nerve injury between the anterior division of the lower trunk of his BP and the proximal portion of his following nerves: ulnar, medial cutaneous of his arm and forearm, and the medial aspect of his median nerve (Figs. and ).\nSurgical exploration revealed a longitudinal laceration of the posterior aspect of his axillary vein, as well as a complete section of his ulnar nerve, his medial brachial and antebrachial cutaneous nerves"}

The pain had persisted for 1 month, and the patient had experienced no symptoms before the injury. Physical examination revealed a positive hyperextension test result, and the range of motion was 0° to 140°. He felt pain during terminal extension and could not endure overextension. There was no swelling or tenderness of the knee. The results of a McMurray test, an anterior drawer test, and a lateral stress test were negative. In the right knee, the results of these tests were also negative and the range of motion was normal.\nA radiograph of the knee was normal. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hypointense cord-like tissue in the anterolateral side of the ACL (), a cyst in front of the tibial insertion site of the ACL (), and hypertrophy of the anterior horn of the medial meniscus (). We suspected that this deformity was symmetrical and therefore performed an MRI examination of the contralateral knee. The right knee was similar to the left, with hypointense cord-like tissue in front of the ACL, hypertrophy of the anterior horn of the medial meniscus, and a cyst in front of the tibial insertion site of the ACL (); however, the cyst was smaller than that in the left knee ( and ).\nArthroscopic examination of the left knee revealed a cyst anterior to the ACL tibial insertion site, an anomalous insertion of the medial meniscus that ran from the anterior horn to the lateral femoral condyle (), and abnormal hypertrophy of the anterior horn of the medial meniscus ().

She had a history of suffering headaches about four to five times a year since age 2 years; her headaches caused a dull pain sometimes accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Because of the recurring headaches, she had undergone MRI of the brain in the pediatric department 1 year ago, which had revealed no evidence of abnormality. Her mother reported that this was not the first time she was experiencing ocular movement limitation during headache. A similar ocular motility disorder had developed when she was 2 years old and lived in the United States at that time. She had been diagnosed with a typical cranial neuropathy in the right eye, which had improved after administration of a steroid. The visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. The right pupil was poorly reactive to direct and consensual stimulus. The ocular motility examination showed a limitation of ocular movement except abduction in the right eye []. There was no ocular injection, chemosis, or pain on eye movement. The fundus showed normal appearance of the optic disc in both eyes. All serologic tests, including tests for thyroid function and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies, were within normal range. Thin-section cranial MRI with MRA of the brain was performed and it revealed a 6-mm nodular enhancement located within the cisternal segment of the right oculomotor nerve, suggesting oculomotor nerve schwannoma without any vascular malformation [Fig. and ]. Although the MRI of the brain performed 1 year earlier had failed to reveal any abnormal lesion at the time, we reviewed the images and found a 3.7-mm thickening lesion of the cisternal segment of the affected oculomotor nerve on the constructive interference in steady-state axial T2 MRI []. Therefore, we concluded that the schwannoma, which had been 3.7 mm in size 1 year earlier, had gradually increased in size and led to oculomotor nerve palsy. The neurosurgeon recommended gamma"}

Biochemical tests including cardiac troponin, serum potassium and magnesium levels were all normal. His previous medical history indicated that there had been two syncopal episodes within the last 2 months. There were no specific triggers for these episodes, but the patient described anginal chest pain immediately before the syncopal attacks. He had experienced no exercise-induced angina, and there were no instances in his family history of sudden death of unknown origin. His echocardiogram results showed that the cardiac chambers were of a normal size, there was normal systolic function of both left and right ventricles, and the wall thickness was also normal. Coronary angiography was administered and a moderate lesion was detected in the middle portion of the right coronary artery (RCA) (). This lesion was evaluated with fractional flow reserve (FFR) using 200 µg and then 300 µg intravenous adenosine injections. The FFR ratio was found to be 0.86. Amiodarone perfusion was administered at the time of his first medical contact, and this treatment was continued for 24 h.

His injury occurred when he suddenly twisted his body. He had a known history of chronic kidney disease and had received regular haemodialysis in our hospital for 9 years.\nThe physical examination showed that both of his knees had massive suprapatellar swelling and that there was apparent depression of the soft tissue above the bilateral patella. Both knees were very soft and could touch the area over the suprapatellar region, and the patella could move freely over a larger range of motion than normal. Upon palpation, the continuity of the quadriceps tendons had defects. In addition, the patient could not complete knee extension adequately.\nAn X-ray of the knees showed that the superior pole of the patella moved downward, and there were calcified deposits in both quadriceps tendons. An MRI scan showed that the continuity of both quadriceps tendons was interrupted at the superior pole of the patella. The patient was diagnosed with bilateral quadriceps tendon rupture.\nThe patient underwent bilateral quadriceps tendon suture surgery under combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia (Fig. ). In the operating room, the patient was placed in the supine position. The surgical area was cleansed and draped, and the same operation was performed on both legs. A longitudinal incision of approximately 8 cm was made on each knee to expose the bilateral quadriceps tendon and the proximal patella. After the haemorrhage and blood clots were cleaned, complete rupture of the quadriceps tendon at the patella superior pole extending to the quadriceps muscle was observed, and the tissue stump appeared dark brown. The surface of the patella was smooth, with no residual tendon tissue attached.

The latest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a recurrence in the parietal region that was reaching up to the ventricular surface. Apart from the parietal lesion, a fresh signal change could be observed in the right MTL suggestive of a separate temporal glioma [-]. The surgical options included excision of parietal recurrence through the previous incision and removal of temporal glioma through a separate temporal approach [] or excision of both the lesions through PTVa using the previous incision []. It was decided to excise both the lesions through PTVa only. Apart from the advantage of targeting both lesions through a single approach, there was an added advantage of lesser chances of developing visual field deficits through PTVa. The preservation of temporal neocortex was another added advantage.\nThe patient was positioned prone with head turned slightly toward the right side. Through the scalp incision, the previous parietal craniotomy flap was raised. The parietal tumor was completely resected. At the end of the resection of parietal tumor, the ventricular cavity was entered as the tumor was extending till and bulging into ventricles. The retraction was applied using the Leyla retractor system so as to get a view of the atrium and the temporal horn. The normal anatomical landmarks, including thalamus, choroid plexus, fimbriae, and body of fornix, were identified. There was no continuity between the parietal and medial temporal tumors confirming the two being concurrent tumors. The enlarged hippocampus was seen along its entire length, except the region of amygdala, that was not in the line of vision.

Laboratory data showed severe anemia (hemoglobin level 6.8 g/dL) and leukopenia (2900 103/μL), but no fever or other signs of infection were identified. Panendoscopy was arranged to evaluate the anemia and revealed an 8 mm irregular ulceration with pigmentation at the distal esophagus (Fig ). A biopsy was performed and the pathological report suggested melanoma. Chest CT was arranged for tumor staging and revealed a 4 cm distal esophageal mass and multiple pulmonary nodular lesions (Fig ). Considering the underlying esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and newly diagnosed esophageal melanoma, this patient was referred to the Department of Radiology for CT-guided lung tumor biopsy in order to confirm which was the advanced malignancy and to decide the treatment protocol.\nAfter reviewing the chest CT images, two small 1.2 cm nodules close to each other in the left basal lung were targeted for the biopsy. The patient was placed in the prone position. After CT localization and local anesthesia, a 17 gauge localization needle was inserted via the intercostal space in the left of the back until the tip of the localization needle reached the posterior superior margin of the nodules (Fig a,b). Biopsy was performed six times using an 18-gauge biopsy needle. Post-biopsy CT revealed regional pulmonary hemorrhage and mild pneumothorax (Fig c).

Five years prior to the incident of right knee pain, he was diagnosed with osteonecrosis of the left lateral tibia. His rheumatologist prescribed Celebrex which managed the left knee pain well. However, the following year, the patient was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver resulting from his antiretroviral medications. Celebrex was discontinued because of the contraindication with liver disease, and Tylenol was initiated for his left knee pain. The patient considered this management plan to be acceptable, particularly in light of his life-threatening liver disease, which became his focus of care. His liver disease had stabilized, and his left knee pain was well managed when the current incident of right knee pain struck.\nThe patient presented with severe pain in his right knee and was unable to weight bear with his leg fully extended. Bone scan in February 2006 revealed osteonecrosis of the right knee, osteopenia in both hips, small fractures bilaterally in the second and third metatarsals, and osteonecrosis of the right medial femoral condyle. The endocrinologist prescribed weekly Fosimax, plus a high dose of calcium and vitamin D and K supplements. The patient preferred not to take Tylenol because of his liver disease, and so his rheumatologist prescribed Tramidol taken at night to relieve morning joint pain.\nNearly one year later, MRI showed osteonecrosis and a medial meniscal tear of the right knee (see ), and the patient was referred to an orthopedic surgeon to explore surgical options. The surgeon advised that minor debridement was not an option because of the lack of healthy bone, and that a total knee arthroplasty would likely be advised within the next two years.

He was otherwise healthy and did not have any history of previous surgical or medical conditions. Physical examination revealed a large nontender mass in the lower abdomen. Routine laboratory data were all within normal limits. Plain radiography of pelvis showed a mass composed of soft tissue and calcifications in its lower part, as well as a short sacrum. Ultrasonography (US) revealed a pelvic mass with both cystic and solid components and also bilateral hydronephrosis.\nComputed tomography (CT) was taken in the district hospital before patient's admission to our center. It confirmed previous findings but it did not delineate the exact relationship of the mass with spinal column to narrow down the differential diagnoses. MRI and MRU were performed to investigate the characteristics of the mass and its possible connection to the spinal cord. MRI showed a 144 × 63 mm2 large presacral mass with septated cystic and solid components arising from coccygeal area without any connections to spinal canal. The lesion caused complete displacement of the bladder anteriorly and to the left side. The right ureter had an S-shaped course around the inferior portion of the mass to enter the shifted bladder (). Voiding cystography also confirmed bladder dislocation to the left lower part of the abdomen and did not show any vesicoureteral reflux.\nSurgical resection of the tumor was recommended. Prior to incision, a urinary catheter and a rectal tube were fixed to guide the surgeon. First, in prone (jack-knife) position a posterior sagittal incision was made. With guidance of rectal tube the mass was carefully separated from rectum, but due to its large volume complete excision through posterior sagittal incision was not possible.

Computed tomography (CT) of abdomen and pelvis revealed multiple gas shadows in the left renal pelvis and the bladder associated with a fistula tract between the lower area of the left pelvis and the splenic flexure of the colon with inflammatory changes () The right kidney showed normal contrast enhancement without any abnormality.\nWith a diagnosis of renocolic fistula, the patient was subsequently explored through a left 11th transcostal flank incision with transperitoneal approach. The splenic flexure and the descending colon were tightly adherent to the kidney around the fistula. The fistula was identified between the left renal pelvis and splenic flexure of the colon. Partial colectomy was performed. There was no evidence of foreign body involving in the formation of the fistula. The lower part of the kidney revealed the necrotic change, and the renal parenchyma was replaced by the yellowish inflammatory tissues. Because of severe adhesion and scarring around the renal hilum and the renal pelvis, left nephrectomy"}

The presenting complaints started about a year back as insidious onset of heel pain which was constant aching in nature and aggravated by periods of prolonged walking and standing. There was no history of trauma. She was a known seropositive rheumatoid arthritis patient on Hydroxychloroquine, Sulphasalazine and Methotrexate for 20 years. She was under the care of a rheumatologist and had steroid injections in the right heel for plantar fasciitis in the past. On examination there was diffuse tenderness around the heel with full range of ankle movements but painful limitation of subtalar joint movements. There was no hind foot malalignment evident on weight-bearing radiographs of foot and ankle (). But that of the ankle revealed a sclerotic line with areas of osteolysis suspicious of a fracture of the calcaneus (). An MRI scan of the ankle with T2 weighted images showed linear high signal intensity in the body of the calcaneus suggestive of an insufficiency fracture of the calcaneus (). The patient was treated with moon walker boot and commenced on oral Alendronic acid 10mg on alternate days for eight weeks with Calcichew and Vitamin D tablets. The patient was advised to use the moon boot while weight bearing and remove at bed time. At the eight weeks follow-up she was completely pain free and able to fully weight bear. The radiographic examination showed the fracture had healed ().\nThe patient was referred back to our orthopaedic clinic after two years by her general practitioner with complaints of recurrence of right heel pain with no history of trauma. On clinical examination there was tenderness around the talus and painful restriction of ankle and subtalar movements. Radiographic examination revealed a fracture of the talus ().

Evaluation of an electrocardiogram with her laboratory examinations and symptoms clearly indicated the diagnosis of acute non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. She was then admitted into one of our cardiology general wards.\nTen years previously, the patient underwent PCI (one coronary stent in the left anterior descending branch, and another in right coronary artery), and about 2 years ago, the patient underwent PCI again (one stent in the posterior branch of the left ventricle) because of similar symptoms. Throughout the last 10 years after the first surgery, she suffered from intermittent chest pain, which had become more intense in the last 3 months. The patient also had a history of high blood pressure for 30 years and had been receiving regular drug therapy during the last 10 years. Her blood pressure was usually controlled at approximately 140/80 mmHg during a resting state. She was never definitely diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus or other diseases.\nAfter admission onto the ward, bedside echocardiography was performed and showed acceptable cardiac function with mild mitral regurgitation. Routine laboratory investigations also eliminated liver and kidney dysfunction. With complete preoperative preparation, the patient underwent coronary angiography (CA) and PCI that night. The CA was performed smoothly and showed a 95% in-stent stricture in the remote area of the right coronary artery (RCA) (). During PCI, right after embedding the stent in the distal area of the RCA, we observed by CA that contrast agent was stranded in the proximal area of the RCA and spread outside of the aortic wall. At this time, the patient immediately felt a foreign body sensation in the throat with mild chest tightness, and thus, a coronary and aortic dissection was suspected (). Cardiologists immediately controlled her blood pressure with an intravenous method and gave her analgesic treatment and rehydration therapy. At the same time, another"}

He has a past medical history significant for benign prostatic hypertrophy and obstructive sleep apnea, and his only surgery was a vasectomy. He reported being a social drinker and previously smoked but quit more than 30 years ago. The patient was adopted; however, he is aware of his biologic mother who had an unknown gynecological cancer resulting in death. He also has multiple maternal uncles who died from cancer of an unknown etiology with the earliest death between 30 and 40 years of age. His physical exam was normal. A recent colonoscopy demonstrated a 3 cm friable mass in the transverse colon at approximately 70 cm. There was a polyp in the cecum which measured 4 mm, polyps in the ascending colon measuring 1.5 cm and 4 mm, and a polyp in the sigmoid colon measuring 8 mm. Histologically, he had an invasive adenocarcinoma arising from a tubular adenoma in the transverse colon. There were findings of tubular adenomas with high grade dysplasia in the descending colon as well as tubular adenomas in the sigmoid and ascending colon. A carcinoembryonic antigen level was normal, and a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was only significant for circumferential wall thickening in the transverse colon. The patient underwent a subtotal abdominal colectomy, removing all lesions. The pathological evaluation identified moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the transverse colon with twenty-three benign lymph nodes.\nDue to the patient's cancer in the transverse colon, with another synchronous high grade dysplastic lesion in the descending colon, and a maternal history of a young gynecologic cancer, genetic analysis of the patient's germline and tumor was performed. Results were obtained from the Molecular Oncology and Cancer Genetics Laboratory, Huntington Medical Research Institute, Pasadena, CA.

{"note": "A 61-year-old male was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma of the right kidney, which was resected in 1994. In 2005, a single 2 cm hypervascular tumor was detected in the head of the pancreas on computed tomography (CT). We suspected that the lesion was the result of pancreatic metastasis of the renal cell carcinoma and performed pancreatoduodenectomy with pancreaticogastrostomy reconstruction. Informed consent was obtained prior to operation. A pathological examination showed that the resected tumor was a metastatic lesion of renal cell carcinoma (data not shown). In April 2011, another single 2 cm hypervascular tumor was detected in the tail of the pancreas on follow-up CT (). Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed no significant FDG accumulation in the tumor of the pancreas compared to the normal pancreatic tissue and no accumulation was detected in other organs (data not shown). The patient had no past history other than that described above and no abnormalities were detected on regular preoperative examinations, including blood tests of the fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c 5.7%) levels. The patient was diagnosed with recurrent pancreatic metastasis of renal cell carcinoma based mostly on his clinical course and preoperative images.\nThe tumor was located 5 cm away from the site of anastomosis of the previous pancreaticogastrostomy. Therefore, we planned to perform distal pancreatectomy in order to preserve the middle portion of the remnant pancreas. The preservation of the spleen was also considered. However the splenic vein was close to the tumor as shown in the CT (); we decided to remove the spleen together. In June 2011, we performed laparotomy with an upper median incision and the adhesion was first dissected. The tumor was located 5 cm from the site of anastomosis in the pancreas and stomach; therefore, we decided to preserve the body of the remnant pancreas as planned (). After the spleen and tail of the pancreas were mobilized from the retroperitoneum, the splenic artery and vein were ligated and divided at the same level at which the"}

These headaches of high intensity occurred on a daily basis and were predominantly located in the left frontal region. The patient reported an episode of severe pain at night, with a state of disorientation and limited motor control that had first occurred 2 weeks prior to admission. An electroencephalography (EEG) was performed at that time and did not reveal any pathological findings. Neither nausea nor vomiting occurred at any time.\nOn admission the clinically and neurological examinations were strictly normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an intraventricular mass lesion (Figs. , and ). The indications for tumor resection were established at the weekly interdisciplinary tumor board meeting.\nThe operation was performed applying intraoperative neuronavigation, intraoperative ultrasound and intraoperative neuromonitoring. Despite an initially unremarkable course of surgery, the first operation for tumor resection had to be aborted shortly after dural opening due to a newly occurring epidural hematoma. Postoperatively a new visual field loss occurred; otherwise no new neurological deficit was encountered. The second operation for tumor removal was performed 8 weeks later. After opening of the dura a soft predominantly greyish tumor with a sharp border to the surrounding ependymal lining, especially in the direction of the cella media of the left lateral ventricle was developed. In a rostral direction a sharp border to the thalamus was visible. A larger tumor node was visualized in the direction of the temporal horn of the left ventricle which appeared to be covered by a thin layer of parenchyma. After fenestration of the parenchyma under neuronavigation, the greyish tumor of soft consistency could easily be separated from the surrounding tissue and was removed. Finally, the tumor portion directed to the midline, adjacent to the internal cerebral veins was prepared. Here, the tumor borders seemed less well defined. The consistency of the tissue appeared hardened and was of more diffuse yellowish-greyish appearance. Altered tissue was removed via a cavitronic ultrasonic surgical aspirator (C"}

His past medical and surgical history was significant for diverticulosis, appendectomy and pilonidal cyst resection. One month prior to his presentation, the patient experienced mild diffuse abdominal pain but denied weight loss or night sweats. His family physician started him on a course of antibiotics for suspected diverticulitis, which improved his symptoms. After 2 weeks, his symptoms returned and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed a possible splenic hematoma as described by the outlying hospital radiologist and he was prescribed a new course of antibiotics. Of note is that the patient was not on any anticoagulation therapy nor had any recent trauma. His symptoms continued thus his representation.\nOn arrival the patient had moderate left upper quadrant tenderness without peritonitis and mild leukocytosis. A repeat CT showed a 7.6 cm splenic abscess with extravasation contrast from the adjacent colon []. Based on these findings the patient was started on intravenous antibiotics and a CT-guided drain was placed in the abscess cavity, subsequently, being discharged home on broad-spectrum oral antibiotics. His drain contents became enteric, consistent with a moderate output fistula. Over the next several weeks, he continued to have moderate output from the drain and worsening abdominal pain. Since this continued to be a moderate output fistula it was decided to proceed with resection.\nApproximately 8 weeks after his initial presentation, the patient underwent a laparoscopic left hemicolectomy and splenectomy converted to open due to inflammatory process involving the spleen, distal pancreas and colonic. We performed a left hemicolectomy, splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy to remove this mass en bloc. The patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated.\nPathology results showed a 10 cm diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of colon with colonic perforation and infiltration into the spleen and pancreas.

Additionally the patient gave history of pain in the left lower limb for the past month with blackening of the toes of left lower limb for the past week ().\nThe patient was found to be hypertensive on general examination. Fine needle aspiration cytology was attempted at a peripheral health centre, and on aspiration of blood, patient was urgently referred to our hospital.\nLocal examination revealed a swelling of about 6 × 6 cms in the left gluteal region. The swelling was cystic in consistency with ill-defined margins and was visibly pulsatile. Additionally, there were ischemic changes in the left lower limb with gangrene of the 1st and 2nd toes. Arterial examination revealed a cool left lower extremity with severely diminished femoral pulse, a normal popliteal pulse, and absent anterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulse. The arterial pulses on the right side were normally palpable.\nA duplex ultrasound of the left gluteal region revealed a deep-seated swelling with a marked arterial Doppler signature (see the video in the Supplementary Material available online at ). A CT angiogram was ordered. The angiogram revealed a remarkably large left internal iliac artery with fusiform aneurysmal dilatation ().\nThis artery was determined to be the PSA because of its continuity with the internal iliac artery, its course which was dilated and tortuous through the lateral thigh, and finally its distal run-off into the popliteal artery ().\nThe left superficial femoral system was hypoplastic and the superficial femoral artery ended distally in the thigh with no connection to the popliteal artery.

The lesion originated in the ascending branch of the left mandible, and the first surgical procedure was performed in March 1997 followed by disease recurrence in April 1999. A second resection was performed in May 1999, and during the next 16 years, the patient underwent several surgical approaches that were consistently followed by disease recurrence. Some of the procedures were conservative surgeries, but others were radical procedures that left her with several deforming scars. She presented to our clinic in January 2015 with a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that evidenced a right, triangular aspect, paracellarlesion, extending to the homolateral cavernous sinus (13 × 9 mm), which was suspected to be a residual lesion that would have achieved the cavernous sinus by contiguity growth after several surgeries. Her last surgery had been performed in April 2014 and was followed by local radiotherapy in May 2014. She was asymptomatic and not willing to undergo a new invasive procedure. She decided to be followed without further intervention.\nFor the next 18 months, she was clinically stable and asymptomatic, but she returned in July 2016 with intense pain on the right side of her face that required multiple hospital visits for intravenous analgesia. MRI revealed an extensive heterogeneous lesion with contrast enhancement centered on the right cavernous sinus anterior to the cavus of Meckel and exhibiting anterior extension towards the upper orbital fissure (measuring approximately 19 × 15 × 16 mm). To identify new treatment possibilities, we decided to perform a new biopsy and conduct molecular testing (Fig. ). A BRAF mutational analysis by the allele-specific protein chain reaction (PCR) certified test revealed the presence of a BRAF c.1799 T > A;p.V600E mutation corresponding to a V600E amino acid substitution.

In addition, the patient also had a loss of the right temporal area of the cranium and a scalp defect 4×3 cm in size in the posterior area and 6×5 cm in size in the anterior area, each of which were tunneled and connected. There was an exposure of the artificial dura graft that had been previously performed, which was accompanied by a chronic infection (). To cover this large scalp defect vulnerable to infection, we needed a broad, not thin, and blood flow-rich muscle flap; thus we used a latissimus dorsi muscle free flap. Intraoperative findings showed that there was a severe injury to the right superficial temporal vessel because neurosurgical operations had been performed several times before and there were no available according recipient vessels. The right facial artery and vein were prepared as a recipient vessel. Consequently, there was a defect of 15 cm in length between the facial vessels and the pedicle of a latissimus dorsi muscle free flap, which was harvested. We used a vascular pedicle of an anterolateral thigh flap as an interposition artery and vein graft. For the vascular graft, an incision was made on the right thigh. Then, the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery and two venae comitantes, a vascular pedicle of the anterolateral thigh flap, whose length was 15 cm, were concurrently harvested. This was followed by an end-to-end anastomosis of the vascular pedicle, graft vessel, and recipient vessel of a free flap in the corresponding order (, ). Insetting of the muscle flap was done for the defect site, on which a split thickness skin graft was performed.\nPostoperatively, all the flaps survived well and the skin graft was successful.

A laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was performed. His final pathology revealed a T3N1 tumor. He received a FOLFOX adjuvant systemic chemotherapy.\nThe patient recovered well and proceeded with standard regular oncologic follow up including interval abdominal CT and PET scans as required.\nAbout 3.5 years after the index operation several new lesions, suspicious of secondary spread were revealed. A lesion in the upper lobe of his right lung was resected thoracoscopically. Another lesion caused a significant obstruction of the right kidney that resulted in nephrostomy tube insertion.\nThe patient was offered a cytoreductive surgery with heated chemotherapy (HIPEC) with curative intent. At surgery HIPEC was performed as planned after resection and excision of all the abdominal load of metastases except for a solid lesion involving the IVC and the 3rd part of the duodenum, deemed unresectable. Due to its presumed irresectability the site was marked with metallic clips for later irradiation.\nAfter surgery the patient underwent a targeted irradiation to the marked site and received additional course of systemic chemotherapy. He underwent further follow up with PET scans, revealing three main lesions with a high uptake on PET, at the previous anastomosis of the transverse colon with small bowel, in the omentum next to the anastomtic site and the metastsasis revealed at previous surgery involving the inferior vena cava, near the entrance of the right renal vein and the third part of the duodenum.

She presented to our clinic in January 2015 with a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that evidenced a right, triangular aspect, paracellarlesion, extending to the homolateral cavernous sinus (13 × 9 mm), which was suspected to be a residual lesion that would have achieved the cavernous sinus by contiguity growth after several surgeries. Her last surgery had been performed in April 2014 and was followed by local radiotherapy in May 2014. She was asymptomatic and not willing to undergo a new invasive procedure. She decided to be followed without further intervention.\nFor the next 18 months, she was clinically stable and asymptomatic, but she returned in July 2016 with intense pain on the right side of her face that required multiple hospital visits for intravenous analgesia. MRI revealed an extensive heterogeneous lesion with contrast enhancement centered on the right cavernous sinus anterior to the cavus of Meckel and exhibiting anterior extension towards the upper orbital fissure (measuring approximately 19 × 15 × 16 mm). To identify new treatment possibilities, we decided to perform a new biopsy and conduct molecular testing (Fig. ). A BRAF mutational analysis by the allele-specific protein chain reaction (PCR) certified test revealed the presence of a BRAF c.1799 T > A;p.V600E mutation corresponding to a V600E amino acid substitution. After tumor board discussion and a careful conversation with the patient, she decided to undergo BRAF inhibitor therapy.\nA treatment regimen with vemurafenib 960 mg PO twice daily"}
{"note": "A 61-year-old male presented with backache for 3 months. A soybean-sized mass accompanied by pain and numbness was found on the front and back of the left ear in October 2015, the left corner of the mouth was skewed and the left eye was partially closed. The patient was diagnosed with facial paralysis at the local hospital and his symptoms did not respond to acupuncture treatment. The mass on the patient’s ear had grown to the size of a pigeon egg by 2017. The swelling, pain, numbness, skewing of the left corner of the mouth, and the left eye insufficiency were also aggravated. There was no fever or weight loss during the course of the disease. The patient had no history of tumours or autoimmune diseases and had no family history of tumours. A physical examination revealed several slightly enlarged lymph nodes under the left ear and in the jaw. The largest node was 1.5 cm in diameter and had a tough texture, good mobility and no tenderness. A hard, slightly tender mass approximately 2×1.8 cm in size was noted below the front of the left ear with poor mobility, no redness or swelling of the local skin, and a low skin temperature. Computer tomography (CT) of the parotid gland identified a mixed tumour that had undergone malignant transformation ( and ). A fine-needle aspiration examination of the left parotid gland revealed that the tumour was of epithelial origin. The diagnosis of reactive lymphoid tissue hyperplasia was determined by a left ear lymph node puncture smear. No distant metastases were found in other organs. The clinical stage was estimated to be T4aN0M0.\nThe primary surgical treatment consisted of a total parotidectomy conserving the facial nerve with a modified ipsilateral radical neck dissection preserving the branches of the temporal and facial trunk and removing part of the zygomatic and buccal branches of the facial nerve. Post-operative pathology indicated that the patient had duct carcinoma of the parotid gland () with invasion to surrounding soft tissues."}
{"note": "A 45 year old female presented with complaints of irregular bleeding per vaginum off and on since the last two months. The general condition of the patient was stable. Per speculum examination revealed a large, firm mass protruding out from the cervical os. Ultrasound scan of the pelvis showed an enlarged uterus with a well defined heterogenous and hypoechoic mass lesion in the posterior lower uterine wall and extending to the posterior cervix, measuring 96 × 62 mm []. Both ovaries could not be localized because of the large uterus and the overall impression was that of a uterine fibroid. The patient was then taken up for surgery and hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was done in view of the enlarged left ovary. Peritoneal washings were also taken.\nA specimen of uterus with cervix and bilateral adnexa was received in the laboratory. Gross examination showed a firm, globular mass which had widened and distorted the cervix. It measured 9 × 6 × 6 cm, cut surface was firm with a whorled appearance and was attached at the isthmus. The endometrial thickness was 4 to 5 mm and no evidence of adenomyosis was seen on gross examination []. The left ovary was enlarged and measured 6 × 4 × 5 cm with a smooth external surface. The cut section was firm with multiple cysts ranging from 1to 3 mm in diameter filled with brownish colored fluid []. The right ovary measured 2 × 2 ×1.3 cm with a smooth external surface and was cystic on cut section. Microscopic examination confirmed the firm, globular mass to be leiomyoma with areas of myxomatous degeneration. Endometrium was in proliferative phase with no evidence of endometrial hyperplasia. No foci of adenomyosis were seen. The right ovary showed a benign follicular cyst with histologically normal fallopian tubes. Peritoneal washings were negative for malignant cells.\nThe enlarged left ovary showed a solid tumor comprising of glands with intervening fibrous stroma. The glands were of varying sizes from small round to large tortuous,"}

Sick sinus syndrome was diagnosed and a ventricular demand pacemaker was implanted via the left axillary vein. The tip of the implanted lead (5076-52 cm, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) was a screw type. The lateral chest X-ray film obtained just after pacemaker implantation demonstrated that the tip of the lead was in the correct position () and the pacemaker threshold was normal. Two days after implantation, she complained of the sudden onset of pain in the left precordial region. On the fourth day after implantation, a bulge appeared in the left sixth intercostal space at the site of the pain. A lateral chest radiograph obtained on the same day demonstrated displacement of the pacemaker lead (). Transthoracic echocardiography did not identify a pericardial effusion, but the position of the lead tip could not be seen accurately. Computed tomography (CT) confirmed penetration of the lead though the RV into the subcutaneous tissues of the left thoracic cavity (). There was no pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. The patient was sent to our hospital for emergency treatment. Because transvenous removal of the pacing lead was thought to be risky, surgical removal and RV repair were performed. Median sternotomy was chosen as the approach because it would be easy to establish cardiopulmonary bypass if required. There was no pericardial effusion, but the pacing lead was seen protruding through the anterior wall of the RV apex and penetrating the pericardium (). When the left pleural cavity was opened, the pacing lead was found to be embedded in the anterior visceral pleura, but the left lung was not injured in agreement with preoperative CT findings. A purse string suture was placed around the lead in the RV wall and a pledgetted mattress suture was added for reinforcement. Then the part of the lead protruding from the RV was grasped with forceps and cut in the pericardial cavity. Next, the pacing lead"}
{"note": "A male patient, aged 8 years, suffered a traumatic injury in the area of the chin and mandibular right and left central incisor and mandibular right lateral incisor after he had been pushed against a wall by a friend at school. The child was referred to the dentist one hour after trauma, reporting intense pain in the traumatic area. At extraoral clinical examination, the presence of contusion lesion and abrasion on the chin was observed (). Considering the traumatic impact on the chin and the possible damage to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), a panoramic radiograph was taken to evaluate this area. The radiographic image indicated normal TMJ structures, without injury (). Thus, extraoral injuries treatment was restricted to the cleaning and disinfection of the damaged soft tissue.\nIntraoral examination revealed the presence of lateral luxation towards the lingual surface of mandibular right lateral incisor (without mobility) and alveolar fracture of the area of teeth mandibular right and left central incisor with lingual displacement (). When mobility was checked, alveolar process showed movement as a unit of the displaced segment, which characterizes the alveolar bone fracture. The alveolar fracture was not visualized on radiographs, since they were taken only after dental trauma treatment. The preoperative radiograph was not taken because the child was in pain and the image was not necessary for the choice of treatment.\nAlthough the traumatic impact caused two injury types to teeth and supporting tissue (lateral luxations and alveolar fracture), the management performed was the same for both situations. After anesthesia with local and intraligamentary infiltration of the displaced teeth, using a full cartridge of 2 percent lidocaine with 1 : 100,000 epinephrine, the mandibular right lateral incisor and the bone segment of mandibular right and left central incisor were repositioned by digital pressure. The bone fracture reduction was difficult to execute because of its extension ().

{"note": "We report a 73-year-old woman, who presented with a sacral fracture that had already been diagnosed in an outpatient setting. In addition, there was strong evidence of a renal cell carcinoma of the right kidney. Despite sufficient pain treatment and accompanying physiotherapy, the patient's mobility was severely restricted by pain at the time of presentation. The patient rated her pain as 9 on a visual analogue scale (VAS) with 10 as the maximum value. Osteoporosis was also suspected and confirmed by bone density measurement, so therapy with bisphosphonates was started in accordance with the guidelines (). In the preinterventional CT of the pelvis and abdomen, a bilateral fracture line running sagittally through the lateral mass of the sacrum could be seen ().\nOn the left, the fracture line traverses the transforaminal zone at the level of the second sacral vertebra. Both in this examination and in an additionally performed MRI, no metastases of the suspected renal carcinoma were observed in the areas of the body examined. The morphology of the sacral fracture was also most consistent with an insufficiency fracture. In order to enable the further therapy of the renal tumor and to achieve sufficient pain reduction, in an interdisciplinary tumor conference, it was initially decided to treat the sacral fracture by CT-assisted balloon sacroplasty. In order to avoid further fracturing and prolonged hospitalization of the patient, we decided on simultaneous treatment of the bilateral fractures. In addition, a biopsy was to be taken for histopathological analysis for definitive exclusion of metastasis. The intervention was performed under intubation anesthesia and anesthesiological monitoring. The patient was placed in the prone position in the CT scan machine. As is routine practice, a single-shot antibiotic was administered (cefazoline 2 g IV). The short axis of the sacrum was selected as the entry plane. Access to the fracture zones was established from dorsal to ventral by two Kirschner wires, which can be directed and angulated easily without causing further damage in the osteoporotic bone. Along the Kirschner wires"}
{"note": "A 32-year-old male sustained a grade 3B (Gustilo and Anderson) open fracture of the right femur following a high-speed motor vehicle accident. A piece of bone from the femur was lost at the site of injury. He did not have any other injury except fracture of the femur. At the primary center, he received wound lavage and splinting of the limb along with systemic antibiotics. Due to lack of facility at the primary center, the patient was referred to the secondary center. After five days of index injury, the surgeon in the secondary hospital performed surgical debridement of the wound and applied external fixator. Culture reports and antibiotic profile of the index surgery are not available due to lack of documentation. The wound healed satisfactorily, and stitches were removed in two weeks. After 15 days of the first surgery (20 days from injury), the operating surgeon removed the external fixator and did intramedullary nailing of the femur without bone grafting (Figure ). The incision wound healed with routine removal of skin stitches. After three months of intramedullary nailing of the femur (nearly four from injury), a blister developed in the lower thigh, which later burst with purulent discharge. The same surgeon after culture and sensitivity of pus administered systemic antibiotics and the discharged decreased after 20 days of antibiotics. After 15 days (five months from injury), the patient presented to another surgeon with similar discharge and was administered empirical systemic antibiotics for a period of 30 days. The patient had marginal improvement with occasional fever and knee pain. Following intramedullary nailing, no further wound washout or debridement was performed by earlier surgeons. At this point (nine months after injury), the patient presented to me with complaint of pain knee, unable to walk, and discharge from the distal thigh.

The patient had referred to her doctor 9 years earlier with pain in the ulnar side of her forearm after getting hit by a heavy object. Clinical and radiographic examinations had failed to reveal any particular pathology and the patient was then referred to a physiotherapist. One year later, the patient returned to her physician with severe pain in the forearm. Plain X-rays were apparently normal, however MR imaging revealed nonspecific lesions in the ulnar bone marrow. These lesions were suspected to be chronic osteomyelitis. Radionuclide and CT scans revealed low density areas in the ulna. Laboratory, microbiological, immunological, hormonal and biochemical tests, including parathyroid tests were all within normal limits. The patient had a biopsy taken by her orthopedic surgeon. The biopsy was apparently consistent with the diagnosis of osteomyelitis, but the culture returned negative. After a while, the patient sustained a fracture in the same bone while asleep which was treated with a cast and healed without surgery. The patient has been complaining of pain and weakness in the left forearm for the past 5 years. Radiographs revealed bone absorption in parts of the ulna (). Five months ago, while attempting to lift a glass, the patient twisted her forearm and broke her radius. Her radiographs showed complete resorption of the ulna (); her arm was subsequently immobilized in a long arm cast. She came to our center and radiographs of her arm revealed non-union of her latest fracture. They also showed bony absorption of the lower end of the radius ( A,B and C). The patient's elbow ROM was nearly normal, so was the wrist ROM except for the final degression of flexion and extension. MTPs and finger motion were normal and the patient's fingers were spared.The neurovascular status had been normal from the onset of the disease and the"}

The patient noted a recent history of a twisting injury of his right ankle 6-months before presentation at our specialty orthopedic clinic. The injury occurred while playing football. Initially, he was treated by his general practitioner, who assumed it to be a severe sprain injury and had placed him on a course of ice compress and anti-inflammatory medication followed by a below knee plaster cast for a period of 3 weeks. Following this treatment protocol, the patient was able to walk but reported on-going pain while walking once the plaster cast was removed. No radiographic imaging was done at the time and was therefore not available for review and comparison.\nOn further examination, swelling was observed over the distal aspect of the medial malleolus, along with tenderness over deltoid ligament of the right ankle. There was no bone related tenderness at the distal tibia. Ankle joint movement was also observed to be normal. We proceeded with a thorough radiograph examination including standard X-rays and 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scanning of the right ankle, which revealed the presence of a small bone fragment located anterior and distal to the medial malleolus (, ). This fragment was not free floating and rather appeared to be attached to the distal tibia. Furthermore, it was a uni-lateral presentation as the patient’s left ankle anatomy did not reveal the presence of a similar bone fragment and was rather normal in appearance (). Based on our findings as well as the findings of previously published reports on this topic, a benefit of doubt was provided, and it was assumed to be a case of acute trauma, leading to a small fracture of the anterior aspect of the distal tibia.\nAt first consultation, the patient was explained of his diagnosis and offered a conservative treatment protocol that included a compression bandage and anti-inflammatory medication.

The primary lesion was excised followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Initial follow-up was for 10 years before discharge. In 2008 she represented with a lump at the left angle of mandible. A fine needle aspiration was suggestive of either benign pleomorphic salivary adenoma or recurrent ACC. A multidisciplinary team decision was made to treat the lesion conservatively. In 2010 the lesion had increased in size and a left total parotidectomy was attempted. Unfortunately, previous surgery and radiotherapy meant that only the superficial gland could be removed safely. Histological examination confirmed recurrence of salivary gland ACC.\nA routine follow-up CT in February 2013 demonstrated a focal liver lesion that was suspicious of metastasis. No other metastases were found on further CT scans of the brain, head, neck, and chest. An MRI of the liver confirmed the presence of a solitary lesion (see ). A biopsy of the lesion confirmed the histological appearance of a metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma that was of identical morphology to the parotid tumour excised in 2010. This had been performed prior to the patient being referred to our unit.\nThe patient was otherwise medically fit and did not have any other significant medical history. She did not take any regular medications.\nIn June 2013 the patient underwent a nonanatomical segment V liver resection and cholecystectomy.

This topical chemical agent was to be applied on the wart with a cotton bud, two to three times during the first week of treatment and then once a week until complete disappearance of the wart.\nUnfortunately the patient did not read the enclosed notice and applied the product to the wart for six continuous hours during the night with use of an occlusive dressing. He was awoken during the night by pain and removed the ointment. In the morning he noted a non-painful skin lesion and two days later presented to the emergency department of our hospital. He had a third degree chemical burn of the ulnar volar side of the first phalanx of the long finger with loss of sensibility on this side of the digit. This lesion presented as a dry skin necrosis of 1.8 cm in diameter with peripheral inflammation without signs of infection (Figure ). Two point discrimination of the ulnar side of the fingertip couldn’t be perceived (>14 mm).\nUnder local anesthesia the entire skin thickness along with part of the subcutaneous tissue was excised and the wound left to undergo controlled scaring (Figure ). During the next weeks the wound became atonic in its center and epithelialization started at the periphery. A flexion contracture of approximately 20° of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint was observed during the scaring process. A second debridement of the subcutaneous tissue was done. The digital canal was intact but the ulnar collateral nerve was found to be exposed.

The patient delivered a viable female infant weighing 3757 grams with APGARs of 8 and 9 at 1 minute and 5 minutes, respectively. Following spontaneous delivery of the placenta, the fundus was noted to be slightly prolapsed through the internal os. A fourth degree laceration occurred at the time of delivery due to the emergent maneuvers utilized to replace the uterus. Brisk vaginal bleeding was noted and 500 cc of blood clot was removed the uterus. Given the patient's inability to tolerate the exam, 1000 mcg of cytotec was placed rectally and the patient was moved to the operating room where general anesthesia was administered. Manual exploration of the uterus was again performed and an additional 1000 cc of blood clot was removed and an anterior fibroid with partial prolapse of the uterus was noted. The fundus was manually replaced superiorly and attention was then turned to the 4th degree laceration which was repaired in standard fashion without complication. Following the 4th degree repair, the uterus was noted to be atonic again and uterine massage and manipulation elicited an additional 500 cc of blood clot. The patient was given two doses of hemabate 250 mcg and the uterus was noted to be firm and hemostasis was confirmed. Total blood loss at the time of delivery was estimated to be 4.5 liters and the patient received 8 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma.

Limited MRI at that time revealed 2 areas of restricted diffusion in the left parietal lobe with increased FLAIR signal and associated cortical/subcortical enhancement. Axial T1-weighted images showed the absence of a flow void in the left internal carotid artery, while the right internal carotid artery appeared patent based on the presence of a normal flow void. Imaging showed no evidence of dissection. The patient underwent stereotactic biopsy of the left parietal lesion to rule out a neoplasm. The results showed nonspecific necrotic changes and no evidence of a neoplasm. She was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation, and over the subsequent months her speech and motor function completely recovered.\nThree years prior to her current presentation, the patient had had a miscarriage at 12 weeks’ gestation.

She had the pain since the previous evening, approximately 14 hours, and had initially presented to her dentist before being redirected. Cardiac risk factors included hypertension, smoking and a positive family history of ischaemic heart disease in her father. The ECG showed anterolateral ST elevation and because of this and ongoing pain, she was thrombolysed with retaplase despite the late presentation. At 90 minutes the ECG changes and pain had not resolved and therefore she was transferred to our tertiary centre for rescue angioplasty. The left anterior descending artery (LAD) was occluded with a large thrombus load. The LAD was successfully opened and a Vision 3.5 × 15 mm bare metal stent was deployed, the procedure was covered with heparin and abciximab and an intra-aortic balloon pump. There was moderate circumflex and right coronary artery disease which was not intervened upon. Cardiac enzymes were elevated with peak CK of >4000 iu/L and troponin I of 98 μg/L. A transthoracic echocardiogram the following day showed a mildly dilated left ventricle (LV) with mild hypertrophy. The anterolateral wall was akinetic with moderate to severely impaired LV function. There was no significant valvular disease and a 1 cm pericardial effusion around the posterior, inferior and lateral walls and right heart with no haemodynamic compromise.

He was mildly obese, described himself as quite heathy, and had never been admitted to a hospital previously. He reported no chronic medical history, such as primary hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, an impaired immune system, malignancies, liver cirrhosis, renal failure, or hemodialysis. He also reported no history of infectious disease, such as tuberculosis, any types of hepatitis, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). His medical history revealed no trauma, blood transfusion, other surgical procedures, or other serious event. He had not lived in an epidemic area and had no contact history of radioactive exposure.

{"note": "A 23-year-old woman had presented with acute onset of shortness of breath. The chest radiograph findings were normal. However, contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis caused by the right posterior tibial vein aneurysm. Leg swelling and pain were not observed. No obvious right ventricular dysfunction was noted, and the pulmonary embolism was peripheral. However, the patient had presented with hypoxia and required oxygenation. Anticoagulant therapy was started, which resulted in the dissolution of the pulmonary artery embolus and posterior tibial vein thrombus. She was discharged with direct oral anticoagulant therapy (edoxaban, 60 mg/day). No venous thrombosis recurrence was noted. No history of leg trauma or injury was noted. The test results for thrombophilia and any autoimmune vascular collagen disorders were negative. Eight months later, the patient decided to undergo surgery. Ultrasound revealed a posterior tibial vein aneurysm without thrombosis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a posterior tibial vein aneurysm with no embolus in the pulmonary arteries or thrombus in the deep veins, including the posterior tibial vein aneurysm ( and ). The aneurysm was believed to be complex because the distal portion appeared to be multilocular and not a simple fusiform or saccular aneurysm. Preoperative venography demonstrated a posterior tibial vein aneurysm that had another communication with the venous circulation (). With the patient under general anesthesia, an incision was made along the medial side of the right lower extremity, and the posterior tibial vein was exposed. We had initially planned tangential aneurysmectomy and lateral venorrhaphy to reconstruct the venous communication. However, it was difficult to expose the entire venous aneurysm because of the presence of severe adhesions. We first controlled the inflow and outflow of blood to and from the venous aneurysm by clamping the respective vessels. Next, venography was performed intraoperatively (). We identified a collateral pathway connecting the distal and proximal ends of the posterior tibial vein through which the blood was transported to the venous circulation, bypassing the aneurysm. Thus, we ligated"}

Until recently, her history of dental treatment had been uncomplicated. Her third molars had been extracted and four of her permanent teeth had been restored with amalgams. Throughout her life, she had visited her general dentist for semiannual recall appointments. Her dental hygienist and dentist had recently detected periodontal pockets around her maxillary and mandibular right molars. They referred her to a periodontist, who recommended extraction of teeth 17 and 47 (FDI) and possible surgical treatment of the upper left molars. Since she had a history of bisphosphonate use, she was concerned about the potential for development of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) after the extractions []. This motivated her to seek a second opinion to explore options for nonsurgical treatment.\nThe patient brought duplicates of periapical radiographs that had been obtained one month earlier by her general dentist. The radiographs revealed the presence of moderate periodontal bone loss around teeth 17 and 16 and early to moderate periodontal bone loss around 27 and on the distal aspect of 37 (not shown). There was severe periodontal bone loss on the distal aspect of 47, which had a pronounced root dilaceration (). In addition, there was a radiopaque mass associated with the distal aspect of 47, near the level of the cementoenamel junction. The size and shape of this mass suggested that it was either calculus or a fragment of a third molar root. The patient's oral hygiene was good and clinical signs of inflammation around the premolars and anterior teeth were minimal. However, there were probing depths of 5 to 6 mm on the mesial aspect of 17 and the distal aspect of 16 and probing depths of 7 mm on the direct palatal and distopalatal aspects of 27.

Routine blood counts and biochemical analyses indicated the presence of an inflammatory condition (WBC: 13200/mm3 and CRP: 35). Urine analysis showed fecal content and increased number of bacteria accompanied with elevated WBC count in the urine sample, which suggested a possible enterovesical fistula. USG examination revealed mildly increased bladder wall thickness and accumulating sediments at the base of bladder. Appendix could not be visualized, but intraperitoneal fat planes around caecum showed increased echogenicity which suggested an inflammatory process. Ultrasound also revealed heterogeneous fluid collection which located lateral to the anterior aspect of the urinary bladder. Prostate and distal portions of the ureters were normal. We obtained an oral contrast CT scan to elucidate the underlying reason. CT examination demonstrated collection of fluid extending from the right anterolateral border of the bladder to the caecum. Outer diameter of the appendix exceeded normal limits (measured approximately 9 mm) and appendix was attached to the right anterolateral part of the bladder. Additionally, hyperdense fecalith image was seen in the distal portion of appendix; also there were 2 cm calculi in bladder (). But our CT scan was not optimal for detection of possible fistula because bladder was not fully filled during CT scan. Although CT scan is the gold standard method for diagnosis of AVF, to avoid excessive radiation exposure to our patient, MRI was performed with full bladder to see fistula tract and confirm our prediagnosis. In MRI, appendix was attached to the right anterolateral part of the bladder, and a 2 cm calculus was detected in the posteroinferior part of the bladder. MRI"}
{"note": "A 9 year old girl presented in the surgical outpatient department with history of a progressive swelling over right scapular region for the last three years. Swelling started as a small lump that increased in size during last six months. Swelling was not associated with fever, malaise and fatigue. There was no history of exposure to any carcinogenic agent or radiation. Past history was not significant. It was her school teacher who asked her parents to seek medical advise for the swelling, as she was facing difficulty in writing.\nThe general examination of the child was normal. Local examination revealed a globular non tender swelling over the right scapular region, measuring 40x36x38 cm, having firm to hard consistency. It was mobile with well defined margins and not attached to deeper structures. Overlying skin was mobile, shiny with multiple visible vessels and a small ulcer noted in the center of the swelling (Fig. ). There was no neurovascular deficit distal to the tumour.\nBlood complete picture revealed mild anemia. Other blood tests including renal function test, liver function test, and serum calcium and serum alkaline phosphatase were within normal limits. X-ray and CT scan of the scapular region showed soft tissue swelling without any bony involvement (Fig. , ). Fine needle aspiration suggested malignant soft tissue tumour. Incisional biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of ES. The lesion was excised and residual defect was left as such with a plan skin grafting at a later stage. The recovery was smooth and patient was discharged on fifth postoperative day. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of ES. All resection margins were free of tumour. Immunohistochemistry was not done. She did not report back for follow up. After three months of surgery she attended the surgical outpatient department with almost healed wound (Fig. ). She was referred to oncologist for chemotherapy. She received VAC regimen (vincristine, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide), repeated every 3 weeks for 6 cycles and local radiotherapy was also given to the excised area. The patient responded well to"}

Two weeks prior to this admission she was seen at Frenchay Hospital with cauda equina symptoms. She has had an MRI of the spine, which showed a disc prolapse but did not explain the symptoms. The patient was discharged. However, her pain continued to worsen, and sensation changes progressed across the whole of the perianal region. She was unable to sit down for 8 weeks due to pain on flexion and started using a stick as her right leg was weak.\nOn examination she had a decreased sensation in the perianal area. Neurological examination of the upper limbs revealed a slight numbness of the radial side of the forearm. Neurological examination of the lower limbs revealed the following: reduced power in the right hip flexion (1/5) and extension (2/5), the power in the left leg was 4/5, absent reflexes in both legs, reduced sensation in the right medial aspect of the distal right calf dorsum of the foot sole and the lateral dorsum of the left foot and the sole of the left foot. On examination of her visual fields, she demonstrated a loss of outer vision in her left eye.\nCT and MRI of the head showed metastases in the right parietal occipital region, together with some smaller metastases associated with the dura and skull base (fig ). MRI of the spine revealed fairly diffuse infiltrating nodules in the nerve roots of the lumbosacral plexus. Her performance status was 3 due to progressive leg weakness.\nThe diagnosis was meningeal carcinomatosis with brain metastasis from breast cancer. No other signs of metastatic breast cancer were seen on CT at this point.\nA year prior to presentation, she had been diagnosed with 4 × 3 cm grade"}
{"note": "The patient, a male 46 years old at the time of our visit, underwent surgical resection of nasal pyramid and premaxilla including the whole upper jaw teeth sparing nasal bones. When the patient came to our clinic, apart from the defect resulting from the resection, he presented with a retraction scar crossing the upper lip from the floor of the nasal defect through the filtrum. The surgical resection was performed in another clinic the previous year, and since then, the patient experienced a severe decrease in the quality of social life including the loss of job and falling into reactive depression. The histological aspect of the neoplasia was characterized by high malignancy and contraindicated a microvascular flap reconstruction in order to allow the inspection of the nasal cavity and the facial skin nearby the nasal defect during follow-up appointments.\nFurthermore, the conspicuous defect and the different kind of tissues needed would have required multiple donor sites, making the achievement of a good aesthetic and functional result quite challenging. Insofar, due to the entity of the defect, the uncertain outcome of the surgical reconstruction, time-costing evaluation and follow-up need, the patient was proposed to undergo zygoma-implant-supported prosthetic restorations.\nRadiographic examination was carried out by means of CT scans of the maxillofacial complex. After the evaluation of the residual maxillary bone, insertion of four zygoma implants was planned.\nThe surgical intervention was performed under general anaesthesia. Our surgical treatment started with an incision extended from the palatal aspect of the second molar site to the crestal aspect of the canine site bilaterally, with two posterior release incisions. A full-thickness flap was then elevated, and the anterolateral wall of the maxilla was exposed. An oval-shaped window was first drawn and was then opened trough the upper aspect of the maxillary buttress using a large round diamond bur. These windows are used to check the right direction of the zygomatic fixtures during their insertion trough the zygomatic bone. Once the maxillary buttress has been prepared bilaterally, the zyg"}
{"note": "A 93-year-old woman was referred to our outpatient clinic for management of acute corneal perforation in the left eye. She had undergone surgery for pterygium of the left eye at the age of 44 years and was treated with topical MMC postoperatively, although she could not recall the MMC concentration used or the duration of administration. Cataract surgery had also been performed on the left eye at the age of 84 years. She had no history of visual problems or symptoms, and there was also no history of diabetes or collagen diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. One month earlier, she had complained of pain in the left eye and a limbal corneal ulcer had been diagnosed by her primary care physician. She was treated with topical medications, but the ulcer became progressively worse and corneal perforation occurred. At her first visit, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/60 in the right eye and counting fingers in the left eye. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was 19 mmHg on the right and 6 mmHg on the left. Slit lamp examination of the left eye revealed a corneal ulcer near the inferior nasal limbus and collapse of the anterior chamber Fig. (). In addition, the uvea near the limbus showed dome-shaped prolapse under the conjunctiva. Focal stromal scarring from previous cataract surgery was seen in the superior temporal limbus. On the next day, urgent penetrating keratoplasty was performed using a donor cornea together with vitrectomy. The graft was attached to the nasal cornea and sclera of the patient with interrupted 10-0 monofilament nylon sutures. A transfixing suture could not be placed at the site of perforation because of corneal melting and thinning. The conjunctiva had covered the exposed uveal tissue in the region of the inferior nasal scleral defect, so additional scleral patch grafting was not performed. The anterior chamber reformed on the first day after surgery Fig. (). Her postoperative course was uneventful and visual acuity of the affected eye was 20/500 at 12 months after surgery (Figs. -)."}
{"note": "An 80-year-old Chinese Han male with a history of recurrent renal cancer originating approximately 10 years prior was admitted to the present facility presenting a self-reported severe left forearm pain present for approximately 2 weeks. The patient reported treatment for recurrent renal cancer within the past 1–3 years, resulting in no apparent impairment to mobility or joint function. Metastasis of cancer tissue had previously been extensively observed in the patient, including brain metastasis treated with Gamma Knife procedures three times over the previous 7 years, as well as lung metastasis (Figure ) first observed 5 years prior to the appearance of the currently described ulnar metastasis. Additionally, the patient had been previously advised to initiate chemotherapeutic treatment for lung and brain metastasis, but refused treatment based on the impact on his quality of life and independent living status. The patient was thus able to remain in independent living conditions with no in-home support or care prior to admission.\nFollowing admission, the patient exhibited no abnormal vital signs. Specifically, no indication was found of hypertension, fever, dyspnea, or other abnormalities. Radiographic imaging revealed a fracture in the left proximal ulna. Coupled with the patient’s previous history of metastatic movement, these findings suggested an initial diagnosis of metastatic bone tumor and resultant pathologic fracture, a diagnosis that was confirmed prior to the procedure by routine biopsy of the affected area. Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient’s family for all procedures included in the current case study.\nAmputation of the affected limb was initially considered because of the extent and size of the lesion, generally considered indicative of poor reconstruction procedure outcomes resulting in limited mobility (Figures , ). The patient was advised that limb-sparing treatment was likely to increase the risk of recurrent metastasis and would likely achieve poor reconstruction outcomes resulting in only partial restoration of mobility. Upon advisement, the patient expressed an explicit preference for a limb-sparing option, resulting in a treatment designed to provide localized disease control without amputation,"}

There was no maternal complication during pregnancy. There was neither family history of congenital anomalies nor maternal exposure to drugs during pregnancy. The baby had APGAR scores of 7 and 5 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. He needed positive pressure ventilation with intubation because of progressive respiratory difficulties and hypoxia. The baby was immediately transferred to our hospital for further evaluation and management after stabilization.\nThe physical examination and laboratory findings for the baby were unremarkable on admission. He had the surfactant replacement therapy for acute respiratory failure. For the next few days, we tried extubation several times, but failed to succeed because the baby suffered from recurrent apnea and hypercarbia leading to the clinical suspicious of CCHS. On day 8 of life, a cranial ultrasound study was performed and it did not show evidence of hemorrhage or mass lesions.\nDuring the second day of life, it was noted that the patient had distended abdomen and was unable to pass meconium without rectal stimulation. A gastrografin contrast enema study showed multiple meconium plugs in the colon suggesting meconium plug syndrome (). Meconium was passed and abdominal distension was relieved after contrast study. On day 6 of life, he showed sustained abdominal distension with poor bowel movement. A barium contrast enema study was needed to rule out other causes of lower gastrointestinal obstruction. It showed a transition zone in rectosigmoid colon suggesting HD. The diagnosis was confirmed by rectal suction biopsy with acetylcholinesterase immunohistochemistry (). The infant underwent an open laparotomy on day 12. He was noted to have long segment HD with a transition zone at mid descending colon. Seromuscular biopsies of the bowel taken 3cm proximal and distal to the transition zone revealed the presence of ganglion cells in the proximal biopsy specimen only.

{"note": "A 58-year-old woman operated with proctocolectomy and an ileal J-pouch 11 years earlier due to ulcerative colitis complicated by colonic cancer presented at a local hospital because of abdominal pain and failure of faecal evacuation. There was a previous history of similar but short and self-resolving episodes of obstruction without clear explanation. A CT-scan aroused suspicion of twisting of the pouch along its longitudinal axis causing an obstruction at the ileoanal anastomosis. An intestinal tube was passed into the pouch for decompression which resulted in relief of symptoms lasting also the day after removal of the tube. She was therefore discharged and referred to our hospital for follow-up with pouchoscopy. However, on the same day as she had been discharged, she presented as an emergency case at our hospital with identical symptoms of obstruction and was admitted to a surgical ward after the application of a tube into the pouch for deflating. Repeated CT-scans at presentation and after application of the tube showed again volvulus of the pouch, which resolved after tube insertion as did the symptoms (). Endoscopy of the pouch including 50 cm of the afferent loop was easily done with no signs of ischemia or obvious twisting. The following day a laparotomy was done in order to fixate the pouch to prevent further episodes of twisting. The pouch was found to be enlarged but in its regular position without twisting and not surprisingly there were no adhesions, either in the pelvis or in the abdomen, which made the pouch completely mobile. A loop of the distal ileum was also found to be twisted behind the mesentery of the afferent loop of the pouch as a remaining part of the volvulus (). After reduction of the distal ileum a pouchopexy was made with one row of multiple interrupted nonabsorbable monofilament sutures (Prolene) to the presacral fascia as well as closure of the open space behind the mesentery of the afferent loop in the same manner. The postoperative course was uneventful and the"}

A head computed tomography (CT) scan and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging study revealed a hemorrhage into the right parietal and occipital regions of the brain. In view of these findings, warfarin therapy was discontinued and as part of the workup a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed and revealed a 4 × 6 mm mass on the aortic valve and a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with bidirectional shunting (right to left after the intravenous injection of agitated saline), mild bi-atrial enlargement, mildly dilated but normally functioning right ventricle, normal left ventricular systolic function and no significant valvular regurgitation. The patient was afebrile and blood cultures were negative. The patient was referred to our institution for surgical evaluation given the TEE findings and the patient clinical presentation. Surgical resection of the aortic valve mass and closure of the PFO were recommended.\nUpon examination of the aortic valve, a filamentous mass was identified on the leading edge of the noncoronary cusp midway between the ranula and the commisure. The mass was excised with sharp dissection. A second 2 × 3 mm mass was also observed on the underside of the leaflet and was excised in a similar fashion. Lesions were also observed at the commisure and on the left coronary cusp and were also excised. Pathologic examination subsequently revealed that these lesions were small fragments of myxoid tissue with hyalinization. A modified Maze procedure was also performed at the time of surgery and it required mobilization of the pulmonary veins bilaterally with application of radiofrequency lesions just proximal to the entrance of the left and right pulmonary veins. Another radiofrequency lesion was placed at the base of the left atrial appendage and this was then excised and then over sewn. Finally, the right atrium was then opened in a longitudinal"}

Some months earlier she had been examined at the general surgery department due to abdominal pain.\nThe patient had previously undergone a hysterectomy and was medically treated for diabetes. She was diagnosed with diverticulosis and the suspicion of a cyst in the left ovary. She had experienced constipation problems and pain in the lower left side of the abdomen. The pain increased during movement and when eating. The constipation was improved by lactulose treatment, and as a result she only suffered from abdominal pain during physical activity. Importantly, she also reported occasional incontinence, alternating with difficulties emptying the bladder.\nA gynecological examination revealed a solid mobile tumor below the symphysis, measuring 3 × 3 cm. A transvaginal ultrasound examination showed two normal ovaries and normal findings in the lower pelvis. In contrast, a tumor measuring 2.8 × 2.3 cm closely related to and intruding into the urethral wall was seen.\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a sharply defined tumor, measuring 3 × 3 cm closely related to the vaginal vault (). The tumor caused an impression of the urethra, but invasive growth was not suspected. A transvaginal biopsy of the process showed smooth muscle tissue without signs of malignancy.\nSubsequently, an excision of the paraurethral tumor was carried out in collaboration between urologists and gynecologists. In the beginning of the operation a cystoscopy was performed. A little diverticel was seen in the urethra but there was no observed connection between the paraurethral tumor and the urethra. The operation was performed with only local anesthesia. Lidocaine with adrenalin was injected into submucosa in the anterior wall of vagina. The mucosa was divided lengthwise and the tumor was dissected free. During the dissection a minor lesion of the bladder occurred and lesion was sutured in two layers. Injection with methylene blue fluid confirmed no leakage in the lesion. Finally the pubocervical fascia and the mucosa in vagina were suture"}

Furthermore, our patient presented with a slowly enlarging skin lesion localized on the dorsum of her nose. Gynecologic examination found a 5 cm exophytic friable lesion arising from her cervix and involving the upper half of her vagina. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and the absence of parametrial infiltration; neither adenopathies nor distant metastases were found. In addition, a skin inspection found a 2 cm solitary nodule on the dorsum of the nose: the lesion bled spontaneously at the examination and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma of the skin.\nOur patient refused the surgical excision of the nasal lesion, and so treatment consisted of radiation therapy; 30 Gy external beam radiation was delivered in 10 fractions with 3 Gy per fraction over two weeks, followed by 30 Gy delivered by brachytherapy.\nThe cervical carcinoma was treated with radiation therapy. A whole pelvic external beam radiation dose of 40 Gy was delivered in 20 fractions with 2 Gy per fraction over four weeks, followed by 30 Gy delivered by brachytherapy. In summary, she received 70 Gy total dose radiation on the cervical cancer, and 60 Gy total dose radiation on the skin cancer.\nOur patient remained in good control and free from relapsed disease over 17 years. At the age of 78 years, she presented with a rapid worsening of performance status. Gynecologic examination didn't reveal any recurrent disease or recurrent skin lesion. However, systematic liver ultrasounds showed multiple diffuse nodular lesions. We performed a computed tomography of her thorax, abdomen and pelvis. Imaging showed diffuse metastatic nodules of her lungs and liver; there was no evidence of relapsing pelvic tumor (Figure ).

It was interfering with her right knee movement and walking. It was not associated with any significant trauma and started insidiously. She did not experience any loss of appetite, loss of weight or fever during and around the time of presentation. She had no other known medical conditions prior to this and was not on any medications.\nExamination of the patient showed a medium built girl with a large swelling measuring 10 cm by 15 cm over her right leg, just below the knee. She did not appear wasted and was walking with an antalgic gait. The skin over the swelling appeared shiny, indurated with visible dilated veins overlying it. Her vital signs were normal and there was no evidence of pallor. On palpation, there was a warm hard swelling arising from the proximal right tibia not crossing the knee joint. It was a smooth lobular swelling, tender on deep palpation. Range of motion for the right knee was 0° to 100° compared to 0° to 140° on the contralateral side. There was no clinical evidence of knee effusion. Examination of all other systems was unremarkable.\nPlain radiographs (Figure ) showed classical features consistent with osteosarcoma of the proximal tibia. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging showed that the tumour was limited to the proximal tibia without involvement of the knee joint and the neurovascular bundle was free from the tumour (Figure ). Computer Tomography of the chest and bone scan revealed that the tumour was localize to right proximal tibia without metastasis to the lung or other bones. The clinical examination and radiological findings were consistent with an initial diagnosis of osteosarcoma of the right proximal tibia. Histopathological findings of a large-core tissue biopsy performed showed chondromyxoid matrix and atypical chondrocytes containing enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei. There were also abnormal spindle cells producing osteoid present."}
{"note": "A 68-year-old non-smoking Chinese woman with SIT was referred to our hospital because of an abnormal shadow on chest radiography for 4 days. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed an irregularly shaped nodule (measuring 38 × 27 mm in diameter) in the pleural area of the left lower lobe and SIT () and a 5-mm nodule in the dorsal segment of the lower lobe of the left lung (). Bronchoscopy confirmed that the left and right bronchial branches were mirror images of each other. Because we were unable to obtain a definitive diagnosis by the bronchoscopic approach, we performed CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy and surgery was planned for diagnosis and treatment. Intraoperatively, we established that the location of the superior vena cava and azygos vein mirrored the normal distribution, and that the aortic arch was absent from the left thoracic cavity. The left lung was well lobulated into three lobes and the anatomy of the left side of the pulmonary artery had features typical of the normal right side.\nOn 9 January 2018, the patient underwent thoracoscopic wedge resection of the left lower lobe of the lung plus lymphadenectomy. The tumor was located in the lower left lobe. The location of the lesion in the basal segment was obvious and the interlobar fissure was removed. Wedge resection of the two lesions was performed to remove the lesions and they were sent for rapid pathology. Pathology showed that the tumor in the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe was adenocarcinoma in situ (0.5 cm in diameter) and the mass in the basal segment was a fusiform cell soft tissue tumor with sclerotic, slightly heteromorphic cells. These findings suggested that we should treat the lesions as borderline tumors. Precise diagnosis needed to be performed by immunohistochemistry. The lymph nodes of 11 groups were removed.\nPostoperative pathology showed that the tumor in the dorsal segment of the lower left lobe was adenocarcinoma in situ (0.6 × 0.5 cm), without invasion of the local pulmonary capsule and without"}

Two weeks prior to her presentation, she reported fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and pain on the right side of the abdomen. She had presented to the ED one week prior due to abdominal pain with a mild elevation in her liver enzymes. No acute pathology was discovered, and she was told to follow-up with her primary care physician (PCP). She then presented to an urgent care facility in which she was prescribed ciprofloxacin with eventual improvement in her diarrhea and vomiting. Three days prior to arrival, she began to note numbness and weakness of her fingers and toes. Her weakness was most noticeable in the distal aspects of her extremities, and she experienced some difficulty ambulating and a prominent decrease in her grip strength. This prompted her to schedule an appointment with her PCP. She followed up with her PCP, who was concerned for demyelinating disease. The PCP urged her to present to the ED for further evaluation. Despite not having any respiratory symptoms or fever, her PCP tested her for COVID-19 and influenza given her abdominal pain and diarrhea. Both tests returned negative.\nFurther history revealed the patient had reported a prior presentation to the ED roughly 10 months earlier for right upper quadrant abdominal pain. She was told she had elevated liver enzymes at that visit and was told to follow-up with her PCP. Her PCP had tested her for hepatitis C, which was negative, and she eventually had resolution of her clinical symptoms. She denied any recent travel, fevers, or shortness of breath. She had mostly been indoors for the past two months, without reported sick contacts.\nPhysical examination upon presentation to the ED was notable for 4/5 strength in the bilateral upper extremities with flexion and extension of the elbow and wrist.

Over the subsequent 25 years, the patient had undergone repeated colonoscopy with removal of numerous polyps. By her report, some of the polyps were adenomatous, but the outside records were no longer accessible. For several years, the patient carried the diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis. The patient began experiencing increased weight loss and bleeding and therefore underwent subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis five years prior to this admission at an outside hospital. Pathology at the outside facility revealed approximately 50 juvenile polyps most consistent with Juvenile Polyposis syndrome. The patient's mother and half brother reportedly died of colon cancer, both in their 50s.\nThe patient presented to our hospital with recurrent melanotic diarrhea and anemia. Initial physical exam in the emergency room did not mention any alopecia, cutaneous hyperpigmentation, or dystrophic nails. A CT of the abdomen with IV and oral contrast revealed a markedly distended stomach due to mass-like fold thickening and areas of hemorrhage (). A small bowel series was also performed which showed that the stomach was markedly dilated with multiple filling defects and ulceration causing an asymmetrical narrowing of the lumen. There was no evidence of gastric outlet obstruction. Upper endoscopy showed large mucinous fungating friable folds and numerous polyps of various sizes in the fundus and proximal body of the stomach (). The masses were difficult to differentiate into separate lesions. The appearance of the mucosa of both the polyps and the polypoid masses appeared highly cystic and erythematous. There was no active bleeding during endoscopy. Sigmoidoscopy found and biopsied three rectal polyps. Biopsies of the lesions from the stomach and rectum both showed inflamed and edematous epithelium with associated prominent foveolar hyperplasia ().

Her previous medical history included one normal vaginal delivery aged 28, a Mirena IUS in situ, and, a normal cervical screening history. Drugs prescribed included ranitidine and citalopram. Family history included an identified BRCA mutation carried by her mother and aunt. She had not been genetically tested herself but underwent regular 6 monthly checks from ages 41 to 50.\nMultiple fibroids were identified on a trans-vaginal ultrasound of the pelvis. In view of her ongoing symptoms, the patient was offered a hysterectomy with a bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy.\nThe histology of the uterine specimen demonstrated one fibroid measuring 70 mm diameter and showing an abnormal focal area and central cystic necrosis consistent with a low grade leiomyosarcoma surrounded by normal tissue with no evidence of vascular infiltration. The leiomyosarcoma border was 10 mm clear of the serosal surface. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis found no evidence of residual or metastatic disease and her case was discussed at a Gynaecologic Oncology multi disciplinary meeting (MDT). It was agreed that the likelihood of further metastasis was remote and she was discharged from follow-up.\nSix months later, the patient presented to the accident and emergency department with a complaint of numbness in her lower left lip. A full neurological examination was normal so the patient was assured it would likely resolve. However, following a consultation with her dentist, she was referred to the maxillofacial department.

{"note": "This case describes a 29-year-old woman who was first diagnosed with ameloblastoma as a child at 7 years old. The lesion originated in the ascending branch of the left mandible, and the first surgical procedure was performed in March 1997 followed by disease recurrence in April 1999. A second resection was performed in May 1999, and during the next 16 years, the patient underwent several surgical approaches that were consistently followed by disease recurrence. Some of the procedures were conservative surgeries, but others were radical procedures that left her with several deforming scars. She presented to our clinic in January 2015 with a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that evidenced a right, triangular aspect, paracellarlesion, extending to the homolateral cavernous sinus (13 × 9 mm), which was suspected to be a residual lesion that would have achieved the cavernous sinus by contiguity growth after several surgeries. Her last surgery had been performed in April 2014 and was followed by local radiotherapy in May 2014. She was asymptomatic and not willing to undergo a new invasive procedure. She decided to be followed without further intervention.\nFor the next 18 months, she was clinically stable and asymptomatic, but she returned in July 2016 with intense pain on the right side of her face that required multiple hospital visits for intravenous analgesia. MRI revealed an extensive heterogeneous lesion with contrast enhancement centered on the right cavernous sinus anterior to the cavus of Meckel and exhibiting anterior extension towards the upper orbital fissure (measuring approximately 19 × 15 × 16 mm). To identify new treatment possibilities, we decided to perform a new biopsy and conduct molecular testing (Fig. ). A BRAF mutational analysis by the allele-specific protein chain reaction (PCR) certified test revealed the presence of a BRAF c.1799 T > A;p.V600E mutation corresponding to a V600E amino acid substitution.

{"note": "Patient B lives in England and was diagnosed with reactive arthritis causing leg pain when she was 12 years old. She then developed an excruciating headache accompanied by a complete loss of balance and involuntary jerking movements, which resulted in her mother bringing her to the hospital where she was admitted for one night. She was brought back to the hospital daily for several days as increasing and intensifying symptoms developed. The first doctor to assess her wrote, “Hysteria, possible conversion disorder” in her notes. Following this impression, no relevant investigations were performed. Patient B was left deteriorating and untreated, by which time she was having constant seizures and needed a wheelchair. Her mother repeatedly told them that Lyme disease was highly suspected since the family lived in a region known to be epidemic for Lyme disease and other relatives had been diagnosed with the disease and begged them to help her daughter. These appeals were ignored. Her mother took Patient B to a private clinic where a consultant thoroughly examined her and diagnosed encephalitis and possible encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the brain/brainstem/spinal cord), probably due to Lyme disease. She was immediately put on intravenous antibiotics at the clinic for four days. In 36 hours, the seizures had stopped, and her headache slowly improved. Her blood tests came back positive for Lyme disease. The hospital admitted their error and gave an unreserved apology. On instructions from the consultant, Patient B had a further three months of daily intravenous antibiotic treatment at a National Health Service Hospital. After about two months, Patient B was able to walk again, but when the antibiotics were stopped, the seizures and other symptoms returned. The family raised funds to take Patient B to the United States for treatment by a physician who had experience with such cases.

A continuing deterioration of his lung function resulted in the need of a bilateral lung transplantation in 2018 from which he recovered clinically well. Recently, he was analyzed because of jaundice. We saw a slightly icteric man with a body mass index of 21 kg/m2 and a serum bilirubin of 56 µmol/L. Abdominal ultrasound revealed dilated intrahepatic bile ducts and common bile duct. CT confirmed an ampullary tumour of 30 mm with extension into the duodenum (Fig. ). There were no regional lymph node or signs of distant metastases. A particular finding on the preoperative CT scan was the replacement of the entire pancreas with fat (Fig. ). The pancreatic duct could not be visualized. Biopsy of the ampullary tumour revealed an intestinal type adenocarcinoma and therefore our patient was scheduled for a pancreatoduodenectomy. The patient received a single dose of long acting somatuline (120 mg) preoperatively. During the operation, we noticed a lipomatosed pancreas and following transection of the pancreas we could not identify a pancreatic duct in the fatty pancreatic tissue. Taking into consideration that there was no possibility to anastomose the pancreatic duct to the jejunum in a patient using immunosuppressive medication in whom we could not permit pancreatic leakage, and pancreatic insufficiency, which was already known before the operation, we decided to perform a total pancreatectomy with sparing of the splenic vessels. The postoperative course was uneventful and on the 9th postoperative day, the patient was discharged in a clinically good condition, with stable glucose levels and no change in his need for insulin. Pathological examination showed a microscopically radical resection of a pT3bN2(5/16)M0 carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater and a pancreas completely replaced by fat with"}

The presenting complaints started about a year back as insidious onset of heel pain which was constant aching in nature and aggravated by periods of prolonged walking and standing. There was no history of trauma. She was a known seropositive rheumatoid arthritis patient on Hydroxychloroquine, Sulphasalazine and Methotrexate for 20 years. She was under the care of a rheumatologist and had steroid injections in the right heel for plantar fasciitis in the past. On examination there was diffuse tenderness around the heel with full range of ankle movements but painful limitation of subtalar joint movements. There was no hind foot malalignment evident on weight-bearing radiographs of foot and ankle (). But that of the ankle revealed a sclerotic line with areas of osteolysis suspicious of a fracture of the calcaneus (). An MRI scan of the ankle with T2 weighted images showed linear high signal intensity in the body of the calcaneus suggestive of an insufficiency fracture of the calcaneus (). The patient was treated with moon walker boot and commenced on oral Alendronic acid 10mg on alternate days for eight weeks with Calcichew and Vitamin D tablets. The patient was advised to use the moon boot while weight bearing and remove at bed time. At the eight weeks follow-up she was completely pain free and able to fully weight bear. The radiographic examination showed the fracture had healed ().\nThe patient was referred back to our orthopaedic clinic after two years by her general practitioner with complaints of recurrence of right heel pain with no history of trauma.

An MRI scan of the foot and ankle showed insufficiency fracture of the head of the talus (). She was treated in a moon walker boot"}
{"note": "A 3-year-old girl accidentally fell from a chair while playing with her brother; she had been holding a pencil in her hand. She was found lying on the floor with the pencil sticking out from just below her right ear. She removed the pencil immediately by herself and subsequent oozing stopped spontaneously. Her mother reported that the pencil had been fully intact upon removal, and thus it was presumed that it had been completely removed from her neck.\nOn admission, she was alert and crying while seen by the physician. Physical examination revealed a 5 mm laceration accompanied by a small hematoma in front of her right ear lobe []. No other injuries were found. However, her facial movement was asymmetric while she was crying, with no movement of the corner of the mouth and brow on the right side []. In addition, she could not close her right eye tightly. Those findings suggested a right facial nerve injury, which could be either central or peripheral. To rule out intracranial pathology, a CECT was performed. No evidence of intracranial injury or cranial bone fracture was found. CT revealed swelling of the right parotid gland with heterogeneous enhancement and free air just in front of the right carotid sheath [], which suggested that the object penetrated through the parotid gland to that depth. No extravasation was noted.\nA clinical diagnosis of peripheral facial nerve injury was made. It was thought that the facial nerve was damaged just outside of the stylomastoid foramen due to her clinical manifestations. Conservative management was chosen because impalement injuries have the aspect of blunt injuries, and we did not believe that the facial nerve was transected. In addition, surgical intervention would have required a large incision to her face, which may have been associated with cosmetic problems later. She was admitted for observation and intravenous antibiotics. She had an uneventful course. But her facial nerve paralysis did not recover, and she was discharged 4 days after her injury. She is"}

His problem first appeared about 11 years ago, as a small pink lesion on the hard palate and a simultaneous scaly papule on the anterior chest. Several hospital admissions and therapies including antibiotics did not have any effect on the disease. The lesions grew gradually interfering with oral function and finally the diagnosis was confirmed through pathologic and mycological studies. The biopsy results are discussed later. All other test results including blood biochemistry, hematology, sexually transmitted disease (STD) serology, urine analysis and microbiology, and stool exam were within normal limits. Moreover, intact cell mediated immunity was revealed. Imaging studies showed the extent of mass growth and the involvement of surrounding bone. The mass was resected sacrificing the involved soft tissue and bone, and the palatal defect was covered by means of local tissue, only to fail. The patient received Amphotericin B and Itraconazole according to a protocol provided by clinical mycologists of the department of infectious diseases (, ). Finally, after confirming the disease free margins of the defect, the decision to employ free tissue transfer was made. To cover this 38 by 42 mm three-dimensional defect in the palate, a well vascularized thin tissue providing viable skin was needed. Along the length of the pedicle was an issue to facilitate microsurgical transplantation. Thus, a free radial forearm fasciocutaneous flap was chosen ().\nThe patient underwent surgery once the necessary tests were run and the patency of the ulnar artery and deep palmar arch was confirmed preoperatively. The flap was dissected on the nondominant limb in a distal to proximal direction on its radial artery pedicle and venae comitantes. After preparation of the Facial vessels as the recipient vessels, the flap was harvested and transplanted. The nasal lining was restored by split thickness skin graft.

Six days before the hospital visit, the patient experienced numbness in the right upper limb and instability while holding without obvious incentive but did not seek immediate medical intervention. Three days before admission, the patient experienced convulsive seizure in the right upper limb while remaining conscious, which was relieved after 1 min. Similar attacks occurred intermittently on six further occasions. The patient had a 3-year history of hypertension with the highest blood pressure being 180/110 mmHg. He also had a history of smoking and drinking lasting more than 30 years. He was born and has always lived in Beijing, with no history of contact with infested water, infectious zone, other radioactive substances or toxins. Upon admission, the patient was examined to be obese with no subcutaneous nodules. Neurological examinations showed full level muscle strength in the right upper limb, accompanied with diminished needling response. Emergency head CT scan (2016-1-1) showed lower density in the left parietal lobe. As the patient manifested as an acute onset of right limb weakness and hemiparesis,with low density lesions in the left occipital lobe on CT and a history of hypertension, the patient was hospitalised with a preliminary diagnosis of acute stroke and secondary epilepsy.\nAfter hospitalisation, head MRI scan (2016-1-4) displayed a lesion in the left parietal lobe of unknown nature. After enhancement in the magnetic field, a larger area of oedema was found around the lesion in the left parietal lobe which could indicate glioma or other inflammatory diseases. Since the nature of the brain lesion did not match the characteristics of common cerebrovascular diseases, intracranial angiography DSA was used but found no obvious vascular abnormalities or stenosis. Further examinations including lumbar puncture, immune rheumatoid factors and parasite antibody detections were carried out.

The cause of death for this patient was an advanced prostate cancer with numerous retroperitoneal metastases in the region of the posterior abdominal wall. There was a significant hypertrophy of the urinary bladder (capacity of it was more than 1 liter) distention of both ureters and hydronephrosis of both kidneys with the renal failure. We did not notice any signs of other diseases or pathological conditions during the process of anatomical dissection of this cadaver.\nThe right ICA of this patient arose from the CB of the right CCA at the level of the middle third of C3 vertebra (symmetrical to the left ICA). The cervical part of the right ICA (diameter 6 mm) first ascended 40 mm from the site of bifurcation of the CCA (width of CS was 14 mm) in front of the transverse processes of C3, C2 and C1 vertebrae. At the level of C1 the ICA started a looping course (Fig. ) where it sharply turned downwards making the upper bend and descended 22 mm along the anterior surface of the ICA. This part of the right ICA has formed a descending limb of its loop (Fig. ). At the level of the upper border of the body of C2 vertebra the ICA sharply curved upwards making the lower bend and ascended 22 mm along the medial surface of the ICA thus forming an ascending limb of its loop. This limb crossed the level of the upper bend thus forming a complete loop and continued ascending 13 mm more upward and anterolaterally on the lateral wall of the pharyngeal recess toward the external opening of the CC, which it entered obliquely. Due to anterolateral direction of the ICA approaching the external opening of the CC, it entered this canal obliquely (similarly as in"}

During the last six months the patient reported also burning pain in the same area – causing him to wake up frequently during the nightime hours – and progressive inability to perform his regular occupation. No episode of trauma or other medical problems were mentioned. All the symptoms were attributed to carpal tunnel syndrome and the diagnosis was confirmed with median nerve conduction study (NCS). Through a classical open palmar approach subsequent release of the transverse carpal ligament was performed. According to surgeon's operative report, there wasn't any reference for any pathology in the dissected area except from the severely compressed median nerve. However, postoperatively, the patient experienced only partial and temporary relief of his symptoms without improvement of hand function.\nThree months after the surgical procedure, the patient was referred to our department for further investigation. On physical examination, the palmar aspect of the left hand and the area of the previous incision were tender to palpation and swollen while a slight atrophy of the thenar muscles was apparent. There was a sensory loss in the area innervated from the median nerve as compared with the controlateral hand and Tinel's sign was evoked over the median nerve at the wrist. The patient had decreased grip strength while passive flexion and extension of fingers were painful. As a result, additional investigation was deemed necessary and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was selected for delineating any potential pathology in the carpal tunnel or the surrounding tissues. MRI showed a misdiagnosed, volarly placed soft tissue mass with well-defined margins and an ovoid shape which was in direct contact with the flexor tendons (Figure ).\nBecause of the persistent symptoms and the radiographic abnormalities, surgical exploration and tumor resection were scheduled.

An orthopedic surgeon performed an MRI scan which revealed multiple metastases to the thoracic spine. An initial CT scan revealed a right lung mass and a subsequent bronchoscopy revealed a non-small cell lung cancer consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. For first line therapy, he received one cycle of carboplatin and docetaxel which was tolerated well with only mild nausea. He completed four cycles of chemotherapy and a pathology report identified an EGFR exon 19 deletion. The patient started on erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, at 150 mg capsule per day taken by mouth without food or on an empty stomach 1 h before or 2 h after food. Patient was also advised to avoid sunlight while on therapy due to skin toxicity. He tolerated it well and had clinically responsive disease as well as a decrease in primary mass from 5 cm to 2.8 cm on CT scan for over a year until he had started developing worsening back pain and complications caused by papulopustular lesions as well as paronychia and xerosis. He also developed a Klebsiella folliculitis which necessitated discontinuation of the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole that he had been taking for the acneiform lesions and a brief course of ciprofloxacin that had led to the resolution of the papulopustular eruption.\nHe also started to have persistent elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level from 5.4 ng/ml rising steadily to 13.4 ng/ml and eventually rising exponentially to 24.3 ng/ml but continued on erlotinib, dose reduced to 100 mg one capsule per day, due to stable MRI scans.

She had felt a soft mass gradually growing around the posteromedial aspect of her left knee 3 months before her initial visit. She was 154 cm in height and body weight of 50 kg with negative findings from blood and urine examinations. Clinical examinations of the left knee revealed a palpable elastic soft mass that measured around 4 cm × 3 cm with tenderness of the posteromedial aspect of the knee. The range of motion was full but painful snapping of the hamstrings could be reproduced over the mass on active flexion and extension in an arc of 30 to 60 degrees (Video 1 in Supplementary Material available online at ). No swelling, warmness, erythema, tenderness, or hydrops was found other than the medial mass about the knee. A McMurray test elicited pain over the medial aspect of the joint line. No instability was found. Plain radiography revealed grade II osteoarthritis by Kellgren-Lawrence classification in the medial compartment of the left knee. On magnetic resonance images (MRIs), a voluminous lobulated mass measured 40 mm × 23 mm × 20 mm with low intensity on T1 weighted images and high intensity on T2 weighted images was noted just under the flattened sartorius muscle on the posteromedial aspect of the knee (). Multiple small cysts extending from the major cyst to the posterior and anteromedial aspect of the knee were also noted (). A horizontal tear of the middle and posterior segment of the medial meniscus with a communicating tract to the cyst were identified (Figures and ). A diagnosis of a medial meniscal cyst communicating with the horizontal medial meniscal tear with clinical presentation of snapping by the sartorius muscle over the cyst was made.\nArthroscopic surgery was performed under general anesthesia after informed consent was obtained from the patient.

At the same time, he was associated with dizziness and fatigue. The patient was diagnosed as acute pancreatitis and was treated conservatively with good outcome 3 years previously. He was a chronic alcohol abuser, consuming about 200 mL of alcohol daily for the preceding 30 years. On physical examination, his heart rate was 90 BPM and blood pressure was 100/70 mm Hg. He appeared pale and there was no abdominal mass found on palpation. Blood routine examination showed decrease of the hemoglobin values down to 8.4 g/L, a clue of the presence of active bleeding. Intravenous fluid administration and whole blood transfusion of 400 mL were administered. During 12 h of hospital stay and bowel preparation for colonoscopy, the patient had experienced six episodes of hematochezia approximating 1,700 mL. Six units of packed red cell transfusion and intravenous fluids were given following these events. Emergent colonoscopy showed a lot of blood clot at the location of colonic splenic flexure 70 cm distal to anus and the colonoscopy was difficult to pass it, but there was no mass or ulcerative lesions detected. Subsequent emergent DSA of superior mesenteric artery and inferior mesenteric artery did not reveal any abnormalities (). Angiography of celiac trunk was neglected because of suspicious bleeding source from lower gastrointestinal tract. Then abdominal contrast-enhanced CT scan was required for searching the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. Axial CT images and its reconstructed images after contrast injection revealed pancreatic pseudocyst and splenic arterial pseudoaneurysm within it (), an uncommon complication of chronic pancreatitis. Simultaneously, partially ill-demarcated margin with colon and presence of scattered air bubbles within pseudocyst were also seen, a direct evidence suggesting communication between pancreatic pseudocyst and splenic flexure of colon ().

Nine months prior, he visited a local hospital after a motorcycle traffic accident and was diagnosed with an open fracture of the left femur shaft and an intra-articular fracture of the proximal tibia. He underwent an operation using the Ilizarov external fixator at the femur and tibia. Two months after the first surgery, the Ilizarov fixator was removed and changed into a monoaxial external fixator for the left femur and converted to internal fixation with a screw for the left tibia. One month later, he underwent an operation for conversion to internal fixation with intramedullary nailing of the left femur. At that time, he underwent manipulation of the knee joint for ankylosis. On physical examination at the initial visit to our hospital, he had tenderness and dimpling in the superior aspect of the patella and markedly decreased mobility of the patella (including mediolateral and superoinferior translation). He had quadriceps atrophy (a 3-cm decrease in mid-thigh circumference as compared to the contralateral limb). His left knee ROM was between flexion contracture of 30° and further flexion of 90°. On plain radiographs, nonunion of the left proximal tibial fracture and femur shaft fracture were shown. The lateral radiograph revealed a fracture in the superior pole of the patella and patella infera (). The ultrasound showed discontinuity of the quadriceps muscle fiber and hypoechoic hematoma ().\nUnder the presumptive diagnosis of a chronic quadriceps rupture with a patellar superior pole avulsion fracture of the left knee and nonunion of the left proximal tibia fracture, we performed quadriceps reconstruction using tibialis anterior allograft tendon and additional screw fixation. Initially, after removal of the fibrotic nonunion site, 2 cannulated screws were used to fix the nonunion fragment of the proximal tibia at full flexion of the knee (). The fracture site was stable enough not to need any procedure such as additional plating and bone grafting."}
{"note": "A 82- year old male patient, with the only known comorbidities being hypercholesterolemia and sigmadiverticulosis, presented to a nearby hospital with productive cough and progressive dyspnea in the last 14 days. Chest x-ray showed a right lung opacification with pleural effusion. Subsequent chest CT scan revealed a 180° degree counterclockwise torsion of the whole right lung with partial atelectasis of the lower lobe and middle lobe as well as venous congestion and complete atelectasis of the upper lobe (Fig. ). The patient was then transferred to our thoracic surgical unit for further treatment. Upon arrival in our department a chest tube was placed on the right side and 1 l of pleural fluid was evacuated. Furthermore bronchoscopy was performed, showing torsion of the right mainstem bronchus with complete obstruction of the upper lobe. The intermediate bronchus showed even more profound rightward torsion with partial obstruction of the middle and lower lobe orifice (Fig. ). After drainage 12 h later a follow-up CT scan was performed, which showed complete evacuation of the pleural effusion with better ventilation of the middle and lower lobe but persistent lung torsion with suspected pulmonary venous occlusion and venous congestion of the upper lobe. A tumor was not suspected, but could not be excluded due to massive congestion of the whole upper lobe. Therefore the patient was taken to the operating room for diagnostic thoracoscopy. As suspected, the entire right lung was torqued in a 180-degree counterclockwise direction. Since thoracoscopic detorsion could not be achieved and the whole upper lobe showed hemorrhagic infarction, we converted to thoracotomy and performed anatomic resection of the right upper lobe (Fig. ). The upper lobe vein was centrally compressed by a tumor resulting in venous congestion and finally hemorrhagic infarction of the entire upper lobe. This finding was also confirmed by the pathologist who diagnosed a central bronchial adenocarcinoma in the upper lobe with compression and invasion of the upper lobe vein and additional hemangiosis carcinomatosa.

(Table I) This surgeon is an institution PGx champion and has discovered panels are useful in pain management post-op and in the discovery of unrelated, actionable medication related problems (MRPs). The ordering of the panel testing begins with an order being placed in the electronic medical record (EMR). The patient then either goes to the onsite lab to provide a cheek swab DNA sample or a lab kit is sent to the patient’s home for them to provide the cheek swab sample there to mail back to the lab. If the sample is obtained at home, a return envelope is provided the patient in the lab kit so they can return the sample to the lab. Onsite lab results are available in as little as eight days, kits sent to the patient’s home usually takes two to three weeks.

He was admitted to our hospital for detailed examinations and treatment in August 2017.\nHe had high blood pressure and chronic kidney disease. He had a clear sensorium. His body temperature was 36.7 °C. He showed no yellowing of the bulbar conjunctiva, palpebral conjunctival pallor, or abnormal findings in the skin and intraoral mucosa. There was a palpable elastic, soft mass in the left upper quadrant. Although he felt a dull pain in that area, there was no obvious tenderness. There were no palpable superficial lymph nodes nor abnormalities in the extremities. His laboratory findings on admission are shown in Table .\nBecause the results of biochemical tests indicated renal damage, plain abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed. An irregular tumor of approximately 130 mm × 120 mm × 80 mm in size was observed in the left upper quadrant, which corresponds to the transverse colon. No intestinal distention was observed on the oral side of the tumor. Moreover, the tumor was in close contact with the pancreatic body and tail, and the gastric corpus greater curvature, suggesting invasion into nearby organs. Also, mildly enlarged lymph nodes were observed at the periphery of the tumor (Fig. a and b).\nThe total colonoscopy (TCS) performed six days after his first visit revealed a tumor with a circumferential ulcer covered with a thick slough in the splenic flexure of the transverse colon.

{"note": "Our patient is a 48 year old woman with a screen-detected left breast cancer. She was found to have an abnormal bilateral screening mammogram which demonstrated a suspicious area of architectural distortion in the right breast and an obscured nodule in the left breast. This prompted further imaging with diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. This was especially concerning for a solid microlobulated nodule in the left breast measuring 7 mm in size at 3:00 and a persistent suspicious area of architectural distortion in the right breast with two adjacent simple cysts. Bilateral breast biopsy was performed. Ultrasound guided core biopsy of the suspicious right breast lesion was consistent with sclerosing adenosis with usual ductal hyperplasia. No atypia or malignancy was noted. Ultrasound guided core biopsy of the left breast lesion was consistent with grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma, ER 10%, PR 0%, Her2/neu negative (1+), Ki 67 1%. Bilateral breast MRI was performed which showed no suspicious lesions in the right breast and a 2–3 mm ovoid rapidly enhancing nodule with plateau kinetics reflecting a portion of the originally biopsied cancer. No other suspicious lesions were noted within the left breast, left axilla, or internal mammary chain. Her case was reviewed, and the multi-disciplinary decision was to proceed with breast conservative surgery first. She was taken for right partial mastectomy and left partial mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy. Final pathology of the right breast did not show any evidence of malignancy. Initial pathology of the left breast was initially concerning for a biologically unfavorable invasive ductal carcinoma, NOS type. However, further pathologic review revealed that the patient had a grade 2, 8 mm secretory carcinoma. The diagnosis of secretory carcinoma was suspected based on histologic findings which included a microcystic and tubular growth pattern with luminal secretions. The tumor cells were polygonal with eosinophilic to foamy cytoplasm, round nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic activity was minimal.

Her history began six months prior to her visit when she presented with recurrent urinary tract infections. A cystoscopy and TUR revealed a high grade infiltrating urothelial carcinoma in the lateral right wall of the bladder (T2a). Staging CT scans were performed and showed metastatic disease mediastinal and hiliar lymph nodes, multiple and bilateral lung nodules, and metastases located in the internal iliac lymph nodes. The patient was initially treated with six cycles of chemotherapy with gemcitabine 1200 mg/m2 on day 1 and 60 mg/m2 cisplatin on days 1 and 8 every 21 days, showing a partial response after three cycles. The disease was followed up until January 2009, when imaging studies demonstrated the presence of a single metastatic lesion in the left lower lung lobe. A second line of chemotherapy using carboplatin AUC = 3 on day 1 and 1500 mg/m2 gemcitabine on day 1 every 15 days was initiated, and after eight cycles, new progression of the described lung lesion was documented. A third line of chemotherapy was proposed, and in June 2009, the patient was started on cisplatin 60 mg/m2 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 day 1 every 28 days. She had a partial response after two cycles, and after four cycles of chemotherapy, a slight increase in the size of the left lower lung nodule was revealed on the CT scan, although a bone scan was negative.\nWith the diagnosis of a recurrence of a single lung metastatic nodule measuring 56 × 53 × 51 millimeters, in October 2009, a hypo-fractionated course of SBRT was delivered to the lung nodule.

She had no relevant medical history and had undergone cesarean section twice, the first in 1977 due to breech presentation and again in 1979. She had no pertinent family history other than breast cancer diagnosed in her sister and had experienced menopause at 50 years of age.\nThe patient noticed the nodule near the abdominal operation scar with no tenderness 4 years before presentation. The nodule grew quickly in size with no significant pain, even during menstruation. Physical examination revealed a smooth mass measuring 4 cm in diameter on the middle-left side of the cesarean median scar (). A biopsy of the mass showed atypical cells, and subsequent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed two lesions, measuring 2.5 × 3.3 cm and 3.3 × 4.0 cm along the abdominal scar (). The mass located at the right side of the scar consisted of solid components, while that on the left was polycystic. There were no obvious mass-like lesions in the intraperitoneal cavity or any of the abdominal or pelvic lymph nodes. Laboratory tests revealed no increase in the serum levels of tumor markers (CEA, CA19-9, and CA125). Radical resection of the abdominal wall mass was performed with adequate margins under general anesthesia. Histopathological examination showed clear cell adenocarcinoma (), suggesting malignant transformation from endometriosis of the abdominal wall. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed no evidence of malignancy, including in the uterus, bilateral ovaries, and pelvic lymph nodes. Considering these findings together, we diagnosed clear cell adenocarcinoma of the abdominal wall arising from endometriosis after cesarean section. Eight months after the resection, a nodular lesion appeared in the patient's abdominal scar again. MRI and PET scan showed local recurrence, and she was hospitalized for resection of the recurring tumor and abdominal wall reconstruction. Histopathological examination showed the lesion to be clear cell adenocarcinoma. At 15 months after the second"}

Echocardiography showed AAOLCA from the right aortic sinus (Fig. 1-3). The coronary artery took a caudal course below the right ventricular outflow tract. In the absence of signs of myocardial ischemia and since the episodes of chest pain had the characteristics of idiopathic chest pain [] we decided to monitor the patient in the first decade without invasive diagnosis. When she was referred again at the age of 12 years she still had short episodes of chest pain but otherwise she was asymptomatic. To exclude possible myocardial ischemia in the presence of the coronary anomaly we now proposed a full cardiac work up. Cardiac MRI showed normal cardiac function. Treadmill testing revealed good exercise capability without signs of myocardial ischemia while bicycle-stress echocardiography showed normal left ventricular function without any regional wall motion abnormalities. 48-h Holter-monitoring showed sinus rhythm without any arrhythmias. Selective coronary angiography, performed under deep intravenous sedation, confirmed origin of the left coronary artery from the right aortic sinus (Fig. 4-5). The left coronary artery did not take an interarterial but rather an inferior, subpulmonic course. This was further clarified by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (Somatom Force, Siemens) which clearly demonstrated the intramuscular nature of this coronary arterial course (Fig. 6-9, ). Furthermore the CT-scan revealed that the anomalous left coronary artery had neither a slit like opening nor an acute angle of take-off from the aorta which have been identified as possible risk factors for myocardial ischemia in patients with interarterial course []. Since the episodes of chest pain had the characteristics of idiopathic chest pain [] and since prophylactic surgery appeared not justified in the absence of documented ischemia we opted for a conservative approach without restriction of exercise or sports activities and recommended annual follow-up visits [].

A computerized tomographic (CT) scan demonstrated mixed sclerotic and lytic lesions in the left iliac wing. A bone scan demonstrated increased activity in the left sacroiliac joint. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of lumbar spine showed abnormal signal in the left sacrum and ilium, consistent with metastatic disease. This area was biopsied and showed a metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma, diffusely positive for widespectrum cytokeratin and negative for TTF1. Restaging studies did not demonstrate any other lesions. He was subsequently evaluated by radiation oncology and underwent radiation therapy to the left hip. The patient did well over the next 18 months, when he returned with an enlarged skull mass and received site directed radiation therapy. No biopsy of the skull mass was performed at this visit. He presented again in 6 months with a left tibial lesion for which he was treated with palliative radiation. A biopsy performed at this presentation did not demonstrate any neoplasm. Six-months later, he presented with increasing size of the skull mass and was initiated on chemotherapy with a regimen consisting of carboplatin and etoposide. He did have a moderate response to treatment. However, on follow-up, he was noted to have CT evidence of invasive and enlarging osseous metastasis measuring six centimeters (cm) involving the right frontal bone along with mild localized mass effect on the right frontal lobe. Consequently, he underwent another series of treatment with radiation therapy to the skull mass with a total dose of 35 grays (Gy). Despite an initial response to therapy, he subsequently had further progression of the calvarial mass including cutaneous breakdown, and presented to our institution for care.\nA nuclear medicine PET/CT of"}
{"note": "A 59-year-old Asian male presented to the gastroenterology office for a follow-up of a previously found duodenal lesion. He had an EGD at an outside facility 2 years earlier for evaluation of abdominal pain which showed a 1.2 cm duodenal polypoid lesion in the second portion of the duodenum. Pathology of the polyp revealed heterotopic gastric mucosa with benign lobules of gastric glands. He also was found to have chronically active H. pylori gastritis with numerous Helicobacter organisms and atrophic gastritis with patchy areas of intestinal metaplasia. At that time, he was instructed to follow up for a repeat endoscopy for surveillance in two years. As recommended, two years later he presented to our office for surveillance of his duodenal lesion. Due to his history of atrophic gastritis and a large duodenal lesion, we performed an upper endoscopy that showed atrophic gastritis, duodenitis, and a single 10 mm polyp in the second portion of the duodenum. The duodenal polyp was biopsied. Pathology revealed polypoid gastric metaplastic mucosa with focal epithelial atypia including nuclear enlargement, stratification, nucleoli, and few mitoses. The patient was referred for endoscopic ultrasound to further characterize the lesion and complete resection. Several weeks later he underwent an endoscopic ultrasound that revealed a 13-mm pedunculated and sessile polyp on the lateral wall opposite to the major papilla in the second portion of the duodenum (). The polyp was removed en bloc using a hot snare following a 4-mL saline lift. Two endoclips were placed for hemostasis. Pathology revealed a pyloric gland adenoma (Figures , , and ) with predominantly low grade dysplasia (Figures and ) and some small areas of focal high grade dysplasia. The slides were read by the in-house pathologist and were also reviewed by a GI expert pathologist at the University of Michigan. The patient was recommended to follow up for surveillance upper endoscopy in 6 months due to the areas of high grade dysplasia found on pathology. He was lost to follow-up for over one year.

{"note": "A 43-year old, asymptomatic woman was admitted to our hospital by her family doctor after receiving a chest-x-ray during routine clinical examination. The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm"}
{"note": "A 24-year-old man was referred to our gastroenterology department for the specialized management of persistent symptoms such as intermittent epigastric and lower abdominal pain that had begun approximately 7 months earlier. The pain had developed gradually and tended to aggravate after meals.\nOne month prior to his referral to our department, the patient had visited a primary outpatient clinic several times and was administered medication to control symptoms, but his symptoms did not improve. The patient was later admitted to a primary hospital for 1 week, where gastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, abdominal sonography, and laboratory testing was performed to identify the cause of the symptoms. On the basis of these examinations, he was diagnosed with IBS and administered medication. However, because of poor symptom control, the patient was referred to our hospital for specialized management of IBS. The patient had no medical history, including drug history, and had lost approximately 5 kg over the previous 7 months. The patient had a history of 5 pack-years of smoking and social alcohol consumption. The patient's father was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis 1 month earlier and was receiving medication. The patient was employed as a cell phone salesman, but helped with work on his father's farm every weekend. His associated symptoms were frequent nausea with vomiting and diarrhea-like loose stools.\nPhysical examination findings were nonspecific and he showed chronic rather than acute illness. He had no tenderness or rebound tenderness on his abdomen. Laboratory test results of peripheral blood, blood biochemistry, and serum electrolytes were all within the normal ranges. Urine analysis and stool occult blood test showed no abnormal findings. Because of his weight loss, we tested his glucose and thyroid-associated hormone levels. His fasting blood glucose level was 87 mg/dL and the results of the thyroid function test were normal. We reviewed the imaging studies performed at the primary hospital. Gastroduodenoscopy showed chronic atrophic gastritis with erosion, and colonoscopy showed nonspecific terminal ileitis. Abdominal ultrasonography findings were nonspecific. After referral to our hospital, we changed his"}
{"note": "We report the case of a 77-year-old female who complained of a progressively enlarged left thigh in the last year (). MRI showed the presence of a hyperintense mass on T1 and T2 with suppression in T2 fat suppression and STIR projections. The radiologist reported “thigh deep lipoma in contact with the femoral vessels in the medial thigh” (Figures and ).\nTo achieve a good access both medially and externally on the thigh and avoid traction on the ends of the incision, an S shaped skin incision was performed on the anterior thigh approximately along the direction of the sartorius muscle (). Following the outer edge of the rectus anterior, the tumor was located below this muscle and both muscle and tumor were separated by blunt dissection with the finger until the distal insertion of the vastus lateralis (). At this level, the dissection was continued along the medial side of the rectus, sectioning the vastus medialis insertion but leaving enough muscle to allow for reinsertion []. This medial approach allowed a good access to the medial intermuscular septum, where possible surgical vascular injury may have required a vascular suture (). At this level we find the adductor magnus and below it the tibial nerve and popliteal artery and vein. Dissection between the tumor and the medial intermuscular septum caused no vascular injury and a lipomatous tumor weighing 2500 g formed by two masses measuring 16 × 9 cm and 26 × 13 cm could be completely removed (). Histopathological examination reported that it was a low-grade or well-differentiated liposarcoma.\nPostoperatively, the patient had difficulties in flexion and extension of the hip and knee, due to muscular atrophy she presented preoperatively. Therefore, a physical therapy program aimed at increasing the range of motion and muscle power of the hip and knee was initiated. Both parameters were normalized at the control visit at two months. At 12 months the patient was asymptomatic, with no signs or symptoms of recurrence, as well as at four-"}
{"note": "Our patient was a 32-year-old previously healthy female at the 39th week of gestation who accessed the first aim department of a primary healthcare centre of a peripheral hospital for severe dyspnoea and chest pain. Her past medical history did not present other hospitalizations for the same symptoms. Due to the clinical manifestations, the patient was initially treated as a case of pulmonary embolic disease and subjected to a massive anticoagulant therapy. Considering the clinical diagnosis and the child to term, an emergent caesarean delivery was performed in order to avoid foetal complications. The caesarean section was successfully performed under general anaesthesia using Stark's method due to the urgency related to the patient's clinical condition of increasing dyspnoea. Moreover, although the pAVM was still unknown at time of the caesarean section, the execution of spinal anaesthesia seems to be not indicated because of the risk of pAVM association with other AVMs, such as those located in the spinal cord, especially in case of HHT.\nThe foetal outcome showed an Apgar index of 3, 6, and 9, respectively, at minutes 1, 3, and 5; these data are in line with the administration of general anaesthesia and the acute maternal condition of severe dyspnoea.\nTaking into account the foetal weight at birth, it showed a restriction of the expected value. The child weight was in fact 2590 gr at 39 weeks of gestation. However, ultrasounds performed during the pregnancy reported a reduction of the potential foetal growth from the 33 weeks of gestation without any Doppler alteration. This phenomenon should be the result of the chronical adaptation of the pregnancy to the unknown pAVM.\nAs far as the macroscopic exam of the placenta is concerned, a percentage of cotyledons infarcts inferior than 10% was reported.\nConsidering the patient's postoperative course, it showed a subsequently worsening of the clinical conditions, resulting in an acute distress syndrome that required an immediate transfer to the Gynaecology and Obstetrics unit of our structure.

{"note": "The patient is a 57-year-old female who underwent cardiac catheterization via the right common femoral artery two weeks prior to developing a large, symptomatic right common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm ().\nThe patient began complaining of groin pain two weeks after cardiac catheterization. She has a past medical history of aortic valve replacement secondary to aortic valve infective endocarditis, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.\nShe underwent two attempts of ultrasound-guided thrombin injection of the pseudoaneurysm. On ultrasound, the size of the pseudoaneurysm was found to be 5 cm × 3 cm × 4.6 cm. The neck of the pseudoaneurysm was measured to be 0.8 cm long. The two attempts involved using a 21 gauge needle to administer 1000 units and 2000 units of thrombin, respectively, into the pseudoaneurysm under ultrasound guidance and with the assistance of compression. Due to the size of the aneurysmal cavity and a relatively large pseudoaneurysm neck, injections were found to be unsuccessful on follow-up ultrasound (Figures and ). It was then decided to attempt endovascular closure of the neck of the pseudoaneurysm. All risks were discussed with the patient.\nAfter identification by the attending surgeon, the patient was transferred to the procedure room table in the catheterization lab. The patient received IV sedation, and local anesthesia was used prior to ultrasound-guided percutaneous access to the left common femoral artery. During the procedure, vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, were monitored by an ACLS certified nurse.\nAfter a 21 gauge needle was placed into the projection of the vessel lumen, a guidewire was placed into the left iliac artery. An angiographic catheter and guidewire were used to perform selective cannulation of the contralateral right common iliac artery. Then, a 6 French long access sheath was placed to perform an angiogram. The neck of the pseudoaneurysm was visualized (), and a 0.014 guidewire was placed into the proximal portion of the neck.\nA 21 gauge needle was used to cannulate the proximal portion of the neck percutaneously"}
{"note": "A girl aged 12 years was diagnosed with a thoracolumbar kyphosis by her family doctor and was initially followed by physiotherapists to provide exercises for her abdominal and dorsal muscles. She was not referred for an orthopedic assessment until the age of 17 years and eight months when she presented in our clinic with a severe thoracolumbar SK. She was otherwise healthy but overweight with a BMI of 38. There was no history of spinal infections or injuries and no skeletal dysplasias. At presentation, the patient had complaints of persistent back pain in the thoracolumbar junction, which restricted her activities. She had no complaints of leg pain and no neurological symptoms.\nOn clinical examination, there were no neurological abnormalities and the spine demonstrated an extreme kyphosis (113°) with the apex in the thoracolumbar junction, as well as a sharply angular gibbus. She had a mild left thoracolumbar scoliosis of 15° and no spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis. There was no radiographic evidence of anterior bony fusion across the apex of the kyphosis and no bridging osteophytes. An MRI scan excluded intraspinal anomalies, and showed small disc bulges from T8 to T11 with normal spinal cord signal. It also showed no evidence of congenital vertebral anomalies.\nThe indications for surgery included chronic thoracolumbar back pain, as well as the extreme degree of deformity and potential for neurological complications.\nThe patient underwent kyphosis correction at the age of 18 years and one month when the deformity measured 115° and only corrected to 86° on supine hyperextension radiograph against the bolster. The surgery involved a single-stage posterior spinal arthrodesis extending from T2 to L4 with the use of posterior pedicle hook/screw/rod instrumentation and autologous iliac crest bone graft. During the posterior exposure, the spine was found to be spontaneously fused across the apex of the kyphosis from T9 to L1 with fused facet joints and an ossified ligamentum flavum. There was no evidence of congenital vertebral anomalies. Extensive posterior apical closing wedge osteotomies were performed from T6 to"}
