# Streamlit, a Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for data science and machine learning.

# ConversationChain and ConversationSummaryMemory, classes that represents a conversation between a user and an AI and retain the context of a conversation.
# OpenAIEmbeddings, a class that provides a way to perform vector embeddings using OpenAI's embeddings.
# IRISVector, a class that provides a way to interact with the IRIS vector store.
