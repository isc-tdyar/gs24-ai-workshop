{"note": "A a sixteen year-old girl, presented to our Outpatient department with the complaints of discomfort in the neck and lower back as well as restriction of body movements. She was not able to maintain an erect posture and would tend to fall on either side while standing up from a sitting position. She would keep her head turned to the right and upwards due to the sustained contraction of the neck muscles. There was a sideways bending of the back in the lumbar region. To counter the abnormal positioning of the back and neck, she would keep her limbs in a specific position to allow her body weight to be supported. Due to the restrictions with the body movements at the neck and in the lumbar region, she would require assistance in standing and walking. She would require her parents to help her with daily chores, including all activities of self-care.\nShe had been experiencing these difficulties for the past four months since when she was introduced to olanzapine tablets for the control of her exacerbated mental illness. This was not her first experience with this drug over the past seven years since she had been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder. Her first episode of the affective disorder was that of mania at the age of eleven which was managed with the use of olanzapine tablets in 2.5–10 mg doses per day at different times. The patient developed pain and discomfort in her neck within the second week of being put on tablet olanzapine at a dose of 5 mg per day. This was associated with a sustained and abnormal contraction of the neck muscles that would pull her head to the right in an upward direction. These features had persisted for the first three years of her illness with a varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction which would tend to correlate with the dose of olanzapine. Apart from a brief period of around three weeks when she was given tablet trihexyphenidyl 4 mg per day for rigidity in her upper limbs, she was not prescribed any other psychotropic medication. The rigidity showed good response to this medication which was subsequently"}

The patient was in good state and very active. There was not any health problem in the past except a thoracic trauma at work one year ago. In that time the patient was diagnosed with a simple fracture of the 9th right rib without any other consequences.\nOn the X-ray was seen a shadow in the lower part of the right hemithorax. After that, it was decided to perform a CT-scan of the thorax that revealed a tumor of the thoracic wall in the right hemithorax that measured 8 × 4 cm and had a heterogeneous density inside of it. The tumor had involved and destructed the 9th rib and was lying even in two adjacent intercostal spaces, but without involving the lung and muscular layers. On lung window of the CT-scan were seen micronodular infiltrations of both lungs with diameters up to 5 mm and only one nodule in lower lobe of the right lung with diameter almost 1 cm (). The mediastinum was without enlarged lymph nodes and no other lesion was seen in adjacent organs. The conclusion of the radiologist was that probably this was the case of a malignant tumor of the thoracic wall with secondary lesions in both lungs and a biopsy of the tumor was recommended.\nBecause there was not a correlation between the clinical picture of the patient and the conclusion of the radiology it was decided to perform frozen biopsy of the lesions of the right lung and an excision biopsy of the tumor of the thoracic wall. So, through a small posterior thoracotomy at 7th intercostal space were sampled five nodular lesions from the right lung and a sample from the tumor. None of these samples resulted positive (no malignant cells found) after frozen biopsy. In such conditions was considered as more realistic the option of performing an oncologic resection of the tumor of the thoracic wall. (We resected three ribs where the 8th and"}

Physical examination of the patient revealed severe gait disturbance secondary to hip pain aggravated by hip joint flexion or rotation. The patient had no lifestyle habits or specific comorbidities thought to cause femoral head AVN. An anteroposterior view of the left hip revealed sclerosis and collapse of the femoral head and dysplasia of the hip (). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed an increased amount of joint fluid and bone marrow edema in the left hip, and femoral head necrosis was detected on the contralateral side; however, the patient did not complain of any pain (). The patient underwent THA after being diagnosed with idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head, was discharged in good condition three weeks after the surgery without specific complications, and followed up via regular outpatient visits. The patient complained of pain and limited ROM in the contralateral hip joint and gait disturbance one year after the initial surgery. Her symptoms continued for two months and increased over the following three weeks. Repeat MRI revealed similar findings to those noted previously in the left hip (). A second THA was performed (one year after the first THA of the left hip); the patient was discharged in good condition after the surgery without specific complications and followed up via regular outpatient visits (). At the time of the second surgery, the patient was 7 kg heavier than she was at the time of the first procedure and developed a moderate moon face, signs that were initially overlooked as weight gain. Subsequently, the patient complained of intensifying feelings of helplessness and central obesity and muscle mass reduction in both the upper and lower limbs aggravated over a three-month period of outpatient follow-up after the second surgery.

The patient had a history of left elbow arthrodesis performed for posttraumatic arthritis at the age of 18. On physical examination he was tender at the proximal ulna. He had no active flexion or extension at his elbow, which was fused at 90 degrees but achieved 40 degrees of pronation and 60 degrees of supination. His motor and sensory exam was normal at the hand. Radiographs of the forearm and the elbow revealed an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware and a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture (). A decision was made to treat his ulnar shaft fracture closed in a cast, and he subsequently developed a hypertrophic nonunion. At his clinic visit three months after the fall, surgical options for the ulna nonunion were discussed with the patient. We proceeded with conservative treatment for an additional three months, with worsening motion through the nonunion site. He revealed that he was unhappy with the functional limitations of his elbow arthrodesis and inquired about the possibility of converting it to an arthroplasty. The risks of elbow arthroplasty were discussed with the patient at length. Increasing the functional capacity of his arm was his ultimate goal, and understanding that he faced a likely operation for the ulna nonunion, the patient wished to proceed. Due to the patient's prior surgery and history of trauma, as well as risk of infection, we chose to avoid multiple surgeries and combine the repair of nonunion and the conversion of elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty into one procedure. The stem of the ulnar component would thus act as an intramedullary device.\nIn the operating room the patient was placed in a supine position and a posterior incision centered over the elbow was performed. A prior muscle flap that was used for soft tissue coverage at his index procedure had to be elevated. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty. A triceps splitting approach to the elbow joint was then performed and multiple buried pins"}

The pain increased with weight-bearing physical activity. The patient reported no history of trauma before the onset of the knee pain. Examination showed severe tenderness over the medial side of the knee with mild effusion and moderate limitation of range of motion. There was no erythema or increased warmth of the knee. MRI of the left knee showed a moderate-sized focal area of marrow edema/contusion involving the medial femoral condyle in mid and anterior parts predominantly along the articular surface. The patient was prescribed diclofenac sodium 50 mg twice daily and was advised to avoid prolonged weight-bearing activities. Over the next few weeks, the pain subsided and resolved. Three months later, the patient developed spontaneous new onset of pain involving the lateral aspect of the same knee. MRI showed bone marrow edema involving the lateral femoral condyle with complete resolution of the bone marrow edema of the medial femoral condyle. He was treated conservatively with NSAIDs and physiotherapy and advised to use cane to minimize weight bearing on the diseased knee. demonstrates MRI of the left knee in September 2016 and three months later.\nIn April 2017, the patient developed gradual pain over the medial side of the right knee with no obvious swelling.

She was unable to walk for the last 4 years with severe weakness and bone pain. She reported that for the last 2 years she was so weak that she could not turn over in bed and this was associated with pain all over her body. Her condition started as a baby as she did not walk till she was 2.5 years old. Then when she started school she stated she could walk but could never run, the family was poor and never sought medical help for her condition. She got married at a young age of 15 and became pregnant soon after that. During her pregnancy she had difficulty in walking and had pain in her legs, she needed assistance to rise from the sitting position and she was told she would need a cesarean section because she had a contracted pelvis, but she went into labor before she was able to have a cesarean section and she delivered vaginally and developed a fracture of the pubic rami during delivery.\nHer condition over the following years worsened and she was having more difficulty in walking and needed assistance in climbing stairs. She went to several orthopedic surgeons and she was diagnosed as osteomalacia and given calcium and vitamin D without any improvement, till she became totally bedridden. At one time she was also given calcitriol in small doses and for short periods of time 0.25 mg daily. She eventually stopped all treatments when she did not see any improvement in her condition.

Examination showed decreased air entry on the left side and a subsequent chest radiograph showed what looked like a consolidation of that lung and air-filled bowel loops inside the chest and a further ultrasound examination also identified intrathoracic ipsilateral kidney. A computed tomography (CT) of her thorax was performed, which confirmed left-sided diaphragmatic defect with large and small bowel and a normal looking, completely intrathoracic, ipsilateral left kidney and adrenal gland. The baby was delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery with no antenatal diagnosis; she had normal Apgar score and did not require any resuscitation.\nThe procedure was performed in left lateral decubitus position. A 5 mm camera port was inserted by open technique in anterior axillary and two 3 mm working ports were inserted under vision on either side of camera port. The examination confirmed the CT findings (\n). The herniated large and small bowel was pushed and reduced into the abdominal cavity through the diaphragmatic defect which then revealed a completely intrathoracic kidney encased in Gerota's fascia (\n).\nThe kidney was then reduced into the abdominal cavity retroperitoneally by pushing it down through the diaphragmatic defect (\n). A primary repair using interrupted nonabsorbable sutures was achieved without tension (\n). Initially the gas pressure during the reduction in hernia contents was kept at 6 mm Hg but was then reduced to 4 mm Hg during closure of the defect. A chest drain was left in situ through the 5 mm port site at the end of procedure as there was violation of the pleura.\nThe baby had uneventful recovery and was extubated within 24 hours and chest drain was removed after 48 hours.

Three months back patient experienced sudden onset pain in her right groin region while walking and the patient was not able to bear weight on her right lower limb. Then patient was walking with support, bearing weight on her left lower limb. In about a week, patient experienced similar pain in her left groin and was not able to bear weight on either lower limb since then and was left bed ridden. Clinical findings were consistent with coxa vara deformity of bilateral hips with a possibility of bilateral non-union of pathological fracture of femur neck. There was no evidence of any endocrine disturbance, or altered pigmentation or precocious puberty.\nOn imaging it was concluded that the patient suffered from polyostotic fibrous dysplasia with bilateral Shepherd’s crook deformity of the proximal femur with bilateral non – union of pathological fracture of neck femur (). Imaging of the other bones showed evidence of the fibrous dysplastic lesions in the shaft of left tibia ( and ).

He has been concerned with having a cancer that would give him only few days to live. At the beginning, the patient was evaluated medically through detailed history and documentation of his symptoms and then a management plan was created accordingly to exclude cancer. Full history, physical examinations, and radiological and pathological investigations were ordered and the results were all negative for cancer. The physician explained the results of the investigations to the patient but he refused them and continued to insist that he had cancer regardless of the results. The patient was then referred to Psychiatry Department to be evaluated but he could not realize that his symptoms might be of a nonorganic cause, either psychological or mental.\nThe patient continued to visit the general hospital, emergency department, and the primary health care in the institution and was still occupied with the idea of cancer presence. Although the patient was seen by many physicians, the patient was always not satisfied with their conclusions. Eventually a physician reported the case to the department of medical eligibility addressing the issue of continuous primary health care center visits with very variable symptoms, nonconclusive diagnosis, and an unconvinced patient. The department of medical eligibility in the hospital administration took a decision to temporarily limit the patient's file to the psychiatry department to drive the patient to visit the psychiatrist to be evaluated psychologically in order to make his file eligible again. The patient was unhappy at the beginning but he had to visit the psychiatrist. So, an appointment with the psychiatrist was booked and a full psychological and social evaluation was performed by taking a thorough history from the patient. This revealed that the patient fit the criteria of the illness anxiety disorder in which he had a minimum of six months of a persistent belief of having a serious disease which he specifically named. Moreover, this persistent occupation with this belief was disabling and limiting him from having"}

Five months after the first operation, she suffered from increased swelling of the lesion. She was seen by another physician, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed []. The physician felt that it was a simple skin lesion that could be completely removed under local anesthesia. She underwent a second surgery and experienced severe hemorrhaging. Later, she was referred to our clinic. Her physical examination revealed a painful mass lesion measuring 5 cm × 4 cm × 4 cm in the left parietal region at the vertex level. She did not have any complaints except for her esthetic problem. The results of her neurological examination were normal. A vascular malformation at the scalp was considered, and a cerebral MR angiography was performed and revealed a vascular mass lesion, which was located in the left parietal region and supplied by the branches of the left external carotid artery for which venous drainage could not be clearly identified []. Therefore, we performed a conventional cerebral angiography and detected AVM in the left parietal region that was supplied via the branches of the left temporalis superficial artery, left meningeal media artery, and right temporalis superficialis artery []. The lesion did not have an intracranial component and had no direct drainage vein into the dural sinuses. The patient was surgically treated under general anesthesia in the supine position, and her head was elevated at a 30° angle. The skin flap was removed with a horseshoe incision considering the vascularization of the scalp. The vascular lesion in the soft tissue was dissected, and the malformation was revealed.

The patient reported that she was born at full term by spontaneous vaginal delivery and no perinatal problems and no notable postnatal illness were reported. However, in the months following birth, the parents observed progressive enlargement of her right cheek and a differing eyelid width. According to the patient, the facial asymmetry had become more marked over the following years but had not increased in the past few years. No other family members were affected. Patient's mother reported a normal pregnancy. The enlargement extended from the midline to the preauricular region and inferiorly to the lower border of mandible []. The skin of the involved right side of the face was normal in appearance with no alteration in thickness. The extraoral examination revealed that the right side of the mandible was larger than the left side. The outer contour of the right ear was slightly larger and had a different shape compared to that of the left side []. The nose was normal with no deviation although the chin was deviated toward the side of her face.

The patient had a colorectal carcinoma treated by rectum and ileum segment resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy four years before. After radiotherapy ureteric strictures developed on both sides and ureteric stents were placed. At the time of admission the urine specimen showed few white and red blood cells and the urine culture was sterile. During the change of the ureteric stents a retrograde pyelography and cystoscopy were performed, showing a mild gross hematuria coming out of the right ureteric orifice but no further pathological findings. After the stent change, first the hematuria cleared but one day later again an episode of gross hematuria with blood clots in the bladder occurred. A transurethral catheter was placed and a multiphase CT of abdomen and pelvis was performed. CT detected no source of bleeding. The gross hematuria cleared again and an ureteroscopy on both ureteric sides were performed with special emphasis on the right ureter. Once again nothing suspicious could be found. Thereafter gross hematuria appeared again with massive hemorrhage and an arteriography was performed (). But once again no underlying reason for the bleeding could be found. Two days later a gross hematuria with massive hemorrhage occurred. The patient became hemodynamically unstable and needed blood transfusion of 6 U. Therefore, the indication for nephrectomy of the suspicious right side was set and performed. During the operation the ureteric stent was removed and at the end of the operation the hematuria stopped. When the patient left the operation room again a massive hemorrhage was identified within the bladder catheter. Again an arteriography was performed. Finally, the region of the fistula was identified at the distal common iliac artery and a stent graft was deployed across the fistula (). A postoperative angiogram showed complete closure of the fistula (). After adequate blood transfusion and fluid replacement the patient made a rapid and unremarkable recovery. Twelve months later the patient is still well and the stent graft remains patent. However, the patient lost his right kidney."}
{"note": "The patient was a healthy 13-year-old female, who suddenly felt abdominal pain. She was taken to another hospital by ambulance, and the enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 5 cm diameter cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail with fluid collection around it (). The CT results indicated her acute abdominal pain was due to the hemoperitoneum caused by rupture of the pancreatic tumor. Because she had no history of blunt abdominal trauma, the tumor was considered to have ruptured spontaneously. The pancreatic tumor was diagnosed as a SPT of the pancreas from the finding on the CT combined with her age and gender. Since the bleeding stopped by conservative therapy, she was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment at three months after the rupture of the tumor. At that time, she had no abdominal symptoms and the tumor was not palpable. The CT at our hospital showed the cystic tumor was 4 cm in diameter, which protruded from pancreatic tail and was distant from the main pancreatic duct, and the fluid around the tumor had disappeared (). From these findings, an elective laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor was proposed. Since there seemed to be no peritoneal dissemination from the result of laparoscopic exploration, laparoscopic enucleation was performed by using five trocars under pneumoperitoneum. The pancreatic parenchyma was divided with the laparoscopic coagulating shears (). Duration of operation was 126 minutes and with little blood loss. Because the content of amylase in the fluid from the drain placed at the cut surface of the pancreas was 9710 IU/L on postoperative day 3, the postoperative pancreatic fistula was confirmed according to the international definition []. However, because the volume of the fluid from drain was very small, the drain was removed on postoperative day 4. Except for the pancreatic fistula of grade A [], the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as SPT of the pancreas. The negative surgical margin and the rupture of the capsule of tumor were verified by microscopic examination (). She survived"}

After initial management, the fracture was fixed with a dynamic condylar screw assembly. After an uneventful postoperative period, the patient was discharged with advice to undergo supervised physiotherapy. 3 months into the postoperative period, the patient reported to our emergency department with pain in the thigh. X rays revealed a fracture above the dynamic condylar screw at the plate bone interface. The patient was admitted and revision surgery with a longer barrel plate performed. The patient followed up for a period of 4 months and was bearing weight when she again had pain in the peri implant area. Radiographs revealed a fracture of the femur at the new peri implant region. The patient's femoral neck radiograph revealed an osteoporosis grading of 3 according to Singh's classification []. Keeping in view the potential morbidity associated with the repeat plating we planned a method that would be less invasive and less destructive to the local fracture environment. The proposed surgery was explained to the patient and her attendants. The ethical board permission was sought and obtained. The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on a fracture table. The screws in the plate were removed percutaneously under image intensifier control to ensure the patency of intramedullary canal leaving the plate insitu to avoid reexposure of the bone surface. The fracture was reduced and fixed with a reamed antegrade intramedullary nail. Anticipating the difficulties in distal locking with an insitu plate an external locking device comprising of a distal full ring and a proximal Italian arch connected by two threaded rods were used. No blood transfusion, bone grafting were used and the mean operating time was 40 minutes.

The initial diagnosis was of acute disc prolapse and he was referred for an urgent neurosurgical opinion. The neurosurgeon concurred that the pain may well have been of neurological origin and arranged an MRI scan. This was reported as showing no evidence of spinal cord pathology. The patient was reassured with the results of the MRI findings and was advised the pain was probably musculoskeletal in origin and should settle. Over the subsequent 6 weeks, the pain persisted and indeed increased in severity. The patient noted claudication-type pain in his right leg after approximately 100 metres. As the pain had not resolved after 6 weeks he revisited his general practitioner. During the subsequent examination the pulses in his right leg were noted to be absent and he was referred for an urgent vascular surgical opinion.\nThe patient was seen the following day in the vascular clinic where a history of severe acute claudication-type pain was noted in the right leg. There was a past medical history of marked hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, for which he took relevant medications, but none of angina, myocardial infarct or valvular heart disease. On clinical examination the heart rate was 68 beats per minute regular. The blood pressure in the right arm 130/70 mmHg was lower than that of the left arm 160/80. Cardiac examination was normal. There was no clinical evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Examination of the limbs revealed that the right lower limb pulses were all absent whilst those of the left leg were present and of good volume. An urgent abdominal ultrasound scan was arranged which demonstrated dissection of the intra-abdominal aorta and a subsequent CT scan (Figures , , ) confirmed that the dissection was a Type A dissection extending from the aortic valve down to the aortic bifurcation. A dissection flap was identified in the ascending aorta and also in the postero-inferior aspect of the descending aorta. Both lumens"}

The initial Rx-ray at admission displayed a femoral neck fracture with dislocation of the femoral head into the pelvis (). The patient also presented macroscopic and laboratory confirmed hematuria. A CT scan was not available at that time, but because of the hematuria we suspected an anterior dislocation of the femoral head. A Foley catheter was introduced into the urinary balder and antibiotics were administrated. Surgery was performed next day in lateral approach of the hip with anterior capsulotomy. The femoral head was not found into the hip but in the pelvis and could not be extracted but only touched by finger through a laceration between the anterior acetabular rim and the decollated labrum, creating a dislocation space similar to the anterior dislocation or the shoulder. However a 50 mm Austin Moore prosthesis was implanted and after the surgery the patient had the femoral head replaced and the fractured femoral head retained as o loose fragment into the pelvis (). The patient was prepared for the next surgery and two days later the urologist extracted the femoral head by a new abdominal approach Gibson with retroperitoneal dissection of the common iliac vessels. The head was placed on the iliopsoas muscle and under the iliac common vessels, and during the procedure no visible injury of the ureter, balder or iliac vessels was found. Soon after removing the abdominal wound drainage the patient experienced pain in the hip, lost mobility and swelling occurred at the hip wound. Several punctures of the hip extracted a large amount of clear liquid which was investigated and was found to have density and elements like urine. A drainage tube was reinserted into the hip wound and the patient underwent repeated urological evaluation by urography and endoscopic techniques.

The tachyardia was repeatedly terminated by intravenous adenosine and verapamil. She was nondiabetic and nonhypertensive. General physical and cardiovascular examination were normal. Her baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) showed left bundle branch block with normal PR interval. The electrocardiogram of tachycardia revealed similar morphology, with the heart rate of 210 beats/min. (). Her transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not show any evidence of structural heart disease. An electrophysiological study was planned with a presumptive diagnosis of AVNRT. Catheter manipulation to obtain His bundle electrogram led to complete heart block because of trauma to right bundle that required temporary right ventricular pacing. No tachycardia could be induced during complete heart block and there was no evidence of accessory pathway. Complete heart block persisted for 3 hours during which she required temporary ventricular pacing support. Patient was discharged after 48 hours with a plan to restudy on recurrence. Within 15 days, she had 3 episode of tachycardia all terminated with intravenous adenosine. After the recurrence of episodes, she was taken up for a restudy with a plan of avoiding His bundle / Right bundle injury and as a part of the same plan to avoid His recording coronary sinus catheter was put from the right internal jugular vein. Three 7 F sheaths were put into right femoral vein and one 6F sheath was put into right internal jugular vein. One catheter was put into high right atrium and another into right ventricular apex carefully avoiding trauma to His bundle. From the internal jugular vein, since the catheter did not follow a normal course, angiogram was done that showed absent right superior vena cava and whole of the jugular system draining into hugely dilated coronary sinus which was missed on transthoracic echocardiogram ().

The insertion of the epidural catheter and operation were finished without any problems and the removal of the epidural catheter was attempted as usual two days after the operation. The epidural catheter broke during its removal. The physician felt resistance when he tried to pull out the catheter and then the catheter was broken 13 cm from the tip. X-rays and a computed tomography scan were subsequently taken (). Although the catheter fragment retaining within the patient was long, a wait-and-see approach was initially employed because there was no neurological deficit. The effusion from the drain hole stopped two days later. No neurological deficit or fever developed after the first evaluation of the images. However, the migration of the catheter was found by imaging studies four weeks after the occurrence of the catheter breakage (). After detailed discussions with the patient and her family it was decided that a surgical removal of the retained catheter should be performed. Then, the patient was referred to our hospital.\nThere was no neurological deficit at the time of admission. A laminectomy was performed at L2-3 seven weeks after the catheter had broken. The patient was placed in the prone position under general anesthesia and then the spinal level that needed to be treated and the retained catheter were identified by using an image intensifier. We exposed the spinal process at L2-3 and the L2 spinal process was split by an air drill.

The initial diagnosis was that of deep venous thrombosis and imaging was undertaken and the patient referred for a vascular opinion.\nOn vascular review, the patient had a pulsatile mass comparable with a popliteal artery aneurysm of 12 cms diameter on the right and 6 cms on the left. His foot was warm and well perfused and his INR was 2.6. He underwent a duplex scan of the lower limb arteries which revealed ectatic iliacs and an abdominal aorta of 3.4 cms in diameter. A further CT arteriogram (fig , ) confirmed that in fact the swelling on the right side was indeed a pseudo aneurysm following rupture with peripheral calcification.\nThe dilemma was therefore a patient with an established pulmonary embolus and a friable clot in the iliac veins, anticoagulation and the treatment of the ruptured aneurysm. Due to lack of expertise we elected to continue with full anticoagulation rather than place an inferior vena caval filter. Operative exploration was performed through a medial approach under full anticoagulation and the right popliteal artery was found to contain a large volume of blood pointing laterally. The popliteal aneurysm was excluded. Duplex examination of the upper and lower limb veins revealed that the veins were of small diameter therefore revascularization of the leg was established by an inlay 8 mm PTFE graft. Due to continuous oozing, the aneurysm sac was packed and the end of the pack brought out laterally. The pack was removed at 48 hours under sedation. The patient made an uneventful recovery. Six weeks later he underwent repair of the left popliteal aneurysm."}
{"note": "On the 24th April 2006 a 9 month old girl was brought to the Emergency Department of a hospital which routinely refers patients to us. She had sustained a dog bite to her face 30 minutes previously. She was seen by the emergency physicians and was found to have received multiple lacerations to her face over the right zygoma, right paranasal area, right cheek, left eye lid, left paranasal area, left lower cheek and over her left body of her mandible. She was fully examined and found to have no wounds elsewhere however due to the circumstances of patient and parental distress, intra-oral examination was not possible. The initial work up did not include radiographic investigations as it was felt by the emergency physicians that only a soft tissue injury was sustained. On the advice of the on-call maxillofacial team she had her facial wounds cleaned with aqueous iodine solution and she was started on an oral course of Co-Amoxiclav and paracetamol. An examination by the ophthalmologist revealed no ocular injury.\nShe was transferred to our unit the following day, fasted in preparation for an examination under general anaesthesia and primary closure of her facial lacerations. During the procedure it was found that she had sustained an open fracture of her left mandible consistent with a dog bite. (fig ). This was treated via a trans-oral approach with a five hole 1.2 mm titanium plate and four 3 mm screws. (fig ). She had her facial laceration copiously irrigated with normal saline and chlorhexidine and primarily closed in with a fine nylon suture. She was discharged home the next day. Seven days later she attended for removal of sutures under a general anaesthetic and examination of her jaw. The facial wounds were healing well and there was no movement at the fracture site. Ten weeks after the first operation she was admitted for removal of her mandibular plate under general anaesthetic. There was good bony union and the plate was removed with no complications (fig ). She will continue to be reviewed in clinic to monitor dent"}

Patient had a past medical history significant for RCC, initially diagnosed at stage II, 11 years ago followed by left nephrectomy. Patient also had metastasis to tail of the pancreas and tip of spleen 6 years ago which was followed by total resection of pancreas and spleen. Patient was followed up for RCC and was last seen 2 years ago when his PET/CT showed slightly increased hypermetabolic area in the biceps femoris muscle which was interpreted as a muscle injury secondary to the rarity of the metastasis to the skeletal muscle from RCC. Patient during the current follow up visit developed a large mass in the posterior side of the thigh which was present for more than a year. As per patient, the mass initially was diagnosed as a blood clot on venous doppler, for which he was treated by his primary care physician with warfarin for more than 6 months. However, the mass progressively increased in size. Patient did not mention of any other constitutional symptoms. On physical examination, a painless, tense mass along the length of biceps femoris muscle measuring more than 25 cm was found in the posterior aspect of the left thigh. The mass was hypervascular and numerous varicosities of different sizes were noticeable on the surface. Patient was imaged using FDG-PET/CT which showed hypermetabolic activity with an uptake value of 3.8 to 4.1 in biceps femoris muscle with multiple serpiginous vessels throughout the tumor, in accordance with a large cavernous hemangioma or an angiosarcoma. This was followed by MRI to better understand the morphology of the tumor, demonstrating a mesenchymal component in an encapsulated mass, raising the possibility of a liposarcoma or an angiosarcoma. A core tissue biopsy was done which demonstrated well defined adipose tissue but because of high suspicion for malignancy, patient underwent preembolization followed by surgical resection. A 28 x 17 x 7 cm resected mass was determined to be metastasis from his primary RCC (Figures , , , , and"}
{"note": "Our patient is a 73-year-old Caucasian female with medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. She had been treated for invasive ductal breast cancer 7 years ago with lumpectomy of the left breast and axillary lymph node dissection. Radiation therapy and seven cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy were administered to her postoperatively, and Anastrozole was prescribed to her for 5 years. She underwent regular annual follow-up for 5 years with chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning with no signs of recurrence or metastatic disease. Seven years after the initial treatment for breast cancer, abdominal CT revealed a solid hepatic lesion at segments VI and VII measuring 7 cm in diameter as well as a 1 cm calcified lesion at the tail of the pancreas (, left). Tumor markers AFP, CA 15–3, CA 19–9, and CEA were all within normal limits and the patient did not have any symptoms or signs of abdominal mass apart from mild tenderness on palpation of the right subcostal region. Moreover, biochemical markers of liver and pancreatic function were normal.\nSubsequently the patient went through oncologic consultation, and both lesions were considered to be resectable, although controversy arose whether they were metastatic or second primary malignancies. CT-guided percutaneous biopsies or laparoscopic biopsies were proposed as minimal invasive methods of diagnosis. The patient rejected both of them due to the risk for possible complications and cancer spillage and decided to undergo laparotomy, open rapid biopsy, and excision of the lesions in one procedure. After accessing the peritoneal cavity through an extended right subcostal incision, we performed hepatic mobilization and exposure of the right hepatic lobe. A solid mass was recognized at hepatic segments VI and VII and rapid biopsy was taken which showed primary HCC. Moreover, after entering the lesser sac, a second rapid biopsy was taken from the lesion at the pancreatic tail which showed chronic fibrosis without elements of malignancy (). We decided to perform resection of hepatic segments VI and VII since intraoperative hepatic ultrasound also confirmed that the mass was resectable with safe oncologic margins. Hepatic segmentectomy was achieved"}

He had initially developed sudden weakness and difficulty using his right upper extremity at the age of 16 years. He eventually had to learn to write using his left hand because of the severity of his weakness. His symptoms progressed over several years, eventually developing into severe symmetrical upper extremity weakness and atrophy in his distal muscles. His lower extremities were spared. Our patient stated he was diagnosed with a type of muscular dystrophy in the US when he was 25 years old. After receiving this diagnosis, he subsequently had a muscle biopsy in Mexico that reportedly confirmed his diagnosis. He had no family members with muscular dystrophy or any other neuromuscular conditions. His symptoms reached their plateau at this time. Because of the stability of his symptoms and his understanding of the disease course, our patient did not seek any further medical care for over 20 years. Upon returning to the US, he was seen by a primary care physician and referred for neurological examination to establish care as well as evaluate the worsening of previously stable chronic symptoms.\nOn presentation, our patient reported a few months of clinical deterioration, particularly recent left upper arm intermittent mild pressure pain. Our patient grew concerned when he noticed increased difficulty performing fine motor tasks with his left hand. In addition, he was experiencing recurrent intermittent episodes of dysphagia while eating solid foods. Our patient denied ever having any previous bulbar symptoms prior to his recent clinical deterioration.\nA clinical examination demonstrated that our patient was thin with significant bilateral upper extremity muscle atrophy and associated weakness. He had severe asymmetric focal segmental atrophy of his bilateral forearm flexor and extensor muscle groups, with preserved and prominent bilateral brachioradialis muscles (Figure ). He had corresponding severe weakness in his upper extremities as measured using the Medical Research Council Scale, with 4-/5 to 5/5 proximal strength and as low as 1/5 strength in his distal muscles.

Her initial system included a Medtronic 4504 passive fixation atrial lead and a Medtronic 4004 passive fixation ventricular lead. She subsequently underwent replacement of her pulse generator in 1998 and insertion of a new Medtronic 5568 active fixation atrial lead and a Medtronic 4068 ventricular leads in August 2003 due to lead failure. She underwent a subsequent generator change in June 2011. The original atrial and ventricular leads were abandoned when the new leads were added in 2003. All procedures had been undertaken at a referring institution and she had not had any prior open-heart surgical procedures. The patient presented at her home hospital with a swollen and erythematous pacemaker pocket in February 2014. Blood cultures did not grow any bacterial or fungal organisms. A trans-esophageal echocardiogram was performed to assess for vegetations on the leads. No vegetations were identified, but there was suspicion that one her atrial lead was extravascular. She underwent chest computerized tomographic imaging and this study revealed that one of her right atrial lead tips was approximately 2 cm within the pericardial space (Figure ). The patient was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone based on a diagnosis of suspected pacemaker pocket infection. She underwent pacemaker pocket exploration and debridement, but extraction was not undertaken due to the increased risks involved with the lead being extra-vascular. No organism was identified from samples of fluid cultured during that initial debridement procedure. Despite that debridement procedure and prolonged antibiotics there was clinical recurrence of the infection and the patient was subsequently transferred to our center for complex lead extraction.\nTo minimize the risk of vascular disruption and tamponade given the chronic right atrial lead perforation, a combined transvenous and open surgical extraction approach was undertaken. Using a dedicated hybrid operating theatre with cardiopulmonary bypass support if necessary, midline sternotomy was performed. Dense adhesions were found within the pericardial space consistent with likely prior pericarditis. Given the location of the RA lead, care was taken to leave the right atrial dissection"}
{"note": "We report the case of a 59-year-old man with hypertension and dyslipidemia, both of which were being treated by his primary physician. The patient suffered a traumatic lumbar fracture in 2013 owing to a fall and underwent surgery. Computed tomography (CT) scans performed at the time were focused on the lumbar spine, so other organs were barely included in the image range and no contrast medium was used. However, when carefully observed retrospectively, the CT scan showed a partial inward deviation of the intimal calcification of the abdominal aorta, suggesting a localized dissection of the abdominal aorta (). However, there was no mention of localized aortic dissection, because the dissection was fairly localized and did not show any abnormal findings, such as aneurysm formation. In addition, the adventitia causing the aortic dissection was also calcified. The findings suggested a chronic aortic dissection that occurred even before the trauma, rather than an acute aortic dissection that occurred at the time of the trauma.\nIn March 2020, the patient was admitted to the emergency department of a nearby general hospital for vomiting. He had no abdominal pain and was subsequently diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis and prescribed oral medication. On physical examination, palpation of the abdomen revealed a pulsating mass, and the patient subsequently consulted his family doctor. After abdominal ultrasound examination, the patient's doctor diagnosed him with an AAA. He subsequently referred the patient to another hospital for a contrast CT scan and a full workup of the AAA. After the enhanced CT scan, the patient was referred to our hospital, where we determined that urgent treatment was necessary owing to the irregular nature of the aneurysm.\nAlthough he did not have any findings suggestive of an infectious disease such as fever or pain, we first considered the possibility of an infectious aortic aneurysm because it was an irregular aneurysm. Upon examination, a pulsating abdominal mass was found, but without tenderness at the site. We conducted a screening test to locate the source of infection. Furthermore, a blood culture was performed, and the results were negative. An oral examination"}

Her mother also reported that her daughter had shown an asymptomatic swelling on the right side of her face since birth. The patient had undergone examination of this condition at 8 months of age. There was history of a gradual increase in the extent of the swelling with age, and the asymmetry of the face persisted. The child was born at full term with normal delivery and there was no history of consanguineous marriage in the family. The child was of normal build and intelligence. There was no familial history of such complaints in the family and serum chemistry revealed no abnormalities.\nThe swelling over the face extended from the zygomatic arch up to the lower border of the mandible on the right side. It was diffuse and had a sponge-like consistency. It was large enough to cause obliteration of the nasolabial fold and the right corner of the mouth seemed to be drooping. No other physical abnormality was noted ().\nIntraoral examination revealed that the cause of pain was the carious right mandibular deciduous second molar. It was also noticed that premature eruption of the permanent mandibular incisors and first molar, and of the maxillary molar was found on the right side. The tongue was also hypertrophic on the right side with noticeably enlarged papillae. The buccal mucosa and gingiva appeared normal ().\nPanoramic radiograph showed that the right mandibular body and ramus were asymmetrically large in size. There was accelerated development of the maxilla and mandible on the right with advanced eruption of the teeth as compared to the left. Radiographic analysis also revealed that all of the teeth on the right side had accelerated root formation relative to their counterparts on the left side.

The patient had given birth to a baby weighing 3500 grams via spontaneous vaginal delivery at 39 weeks of gestation and she experienced heavy bleeding at day 6 after birth. The patient did not respond to medical therapies and conventional methods and underwent hysterectomy due to impaired hemodynamics caused by uncontrolled bleeding. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3 with full recovery. The patient experienced active vaginal bleeding on postoperative day 10 and underwent cuff repair through the vaginal route after exploration. Possible bleeding foci that were inspected during exploration were sutured and then the patient was discharged with full recovery. However, the patient experienced recurrent abundant bleeding on postoperative day 20 for which she was hospitalized and underwent bilateral hypogastric artery ligation. The patient experienced another episode of abundant bleeding on day 7 after the hypogastric artery ligation and she was then referred to our clinic. The patient’s hemodynamics was stable on initial examination. Laboratory parameters were normal. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed normal ovaries and no fluid in the abdominal cavity. A vaginal examination revealed no bleeding. The patient experienced heavy bleeding on day 3 after admission to our clinic and she also had impairment in her hemodynamics. Her hemoglobin was 4.8 g/dL and the patient was administered 4 units of erythrocyte suspension. The patient underwent emergency surgery, but no active bleeding focus was detected. A consultation with a radiologist was performed because no bleeding focus was detected intraoperatively, and the patient underwent computed tomography (CT) with contrast enhancement. The CT scans showed findings suggestive of aneurysmal filling in the pelvic area (). The patient had ongoing bleeding and she underwent angiography in the interventional radiology clinic. Initial angiography revealed an arteriovenous fistula and aneurysm filling from the right internal iliac artery (). The artery fistula was closed with a coil. The right internal iliac artery was totally obstructed by the coil, causing intermittent bleeding after partial intraoperative ligation."}
{"note": "Our patient, an eight-year-old girl, presented to our clinic, with severe swelling and facial asymmetry on the right mandibular molar region. We were informed that the patient developed the swelling as a result of an infection three months previously. The patient had been treated with antibiotics, but as that treatment had not proved successful, she was referred to our clinic. In addition, a passed or congenital disease was not specified in the patient's medical history. Clinical examination revealed severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation and submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region. The patient's skin was of normal color and appearance. In the oral examination, the right mandibular first molar tooth was found to have a deep caries cavity and to not be mobile. The other parts of the oral mucosa were normal. The radiographic examination revealed a deep caries cavity and a radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. There was also a lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible as well as at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus, showing focal new bone formation (). When the axial and cross sections were evaluated during the examination with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a tunnel-like defect was identified in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, starting from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. Bone deposition at the radiolucent area in the center was observed at the lower edge of the mandible as well as the vestibule surface in this region (). When all these findings were evaluated, it was concluded that the pathologic lesion was Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth. In this case, endodontic treatment was considered primarily to retain the infected tooth in the mouth.

For her current episode she was in contact with the local team for the last few years and had presented with moderate to severe depression that needed regular follow up and review of her medication. She also had two inpatient hospital admissions to the psychiatric unit after attempting suicide on two occasions during this episode. During her latest admission, she was treated with different antidepressants and anxiolytics but without any major benefit. Because of the poor control of symptoms of depression, Lamotrigine was added to her other medications (Sertaline and Buspirone which she had been taking for many months). She was started on lamotrigine 25 mg daily which was gradually increased to 50 mg twice daily over the next 2 weeks. Her anxiety and depressive symptoms showed significant improvement on this combination and she started feeling almost back to her normal self. She was continued on this treatment & was discharged from the psychiatric inpatient unit on a combination of Lamotrigine 50mg twice a day, Sertaline 150 mg daily and Buspirone 5mg twice daily. At her weekly follow up, she continued showing improvement in her mental state and the treating team was very satisfied with her response to treatment.\nAbout 16 days following hospital discharge she developed conjunctivitis and over the next 3-4 days, developed swelling of the face and lips. She also developed erosion of the mucous membrane inside her mouth & erythematous papules and bullous eruptions over her body that were particularly bad on the palms of her hands and soles of her feet where she developed detachment of the epidermis.

At clinical examination, both of her eyes were found to have full vision, and also microscopic fundus examinations revealed no pathological conditions. The patient gave a history of a prior application to an outer medical center with the same complaint, and there she had been diagnosed with a left ICA occlusion, following Doppler US and angiographic examinations. The patient applied to our department with the demand of an extracranial carotid Doppler US examination. At Doppler US, the right CCA diameter was found to be 8 mm, whereas the left one came out to be 4 mm (Figures and ). The right CCA bifurcation and the ICA and ECA were found to be normal. At the left side, spectral data for the ECA () and the particular branching which demonstrates that the vessel is ECA indeed were present, whereas there was no Doppler signal and gray-scale findings for the ICA (). Because the left CCA was hypoplastic and there were no findings of atherosclerotic plaques in other arterial segments; it was thought that the left ICA might not be suffering an occlusion at all, but instead it might well be agenetic. Based on the presumption of an ICA agenesis, a computed tomographic (CT) examination of the skull base was performed. CT images revealed a normally appearing right carotid canal but no clear image of the left one (). Then, the previous angiographic images of the patient were reevaluated, and it was then recognized that the left ECA and its branches were well visible, while the left ICA and its branches did not show any filling with contrast (). It was also noted that the filling of the left anterior and medial cerebral arteries was sustained by the patent anterior communicating artery following the injection of contrast into the right carotid artery () and also via the posterior communicating artery following the injection of the vertebrobasilary system ().

{"note": "A 66-year-old man presented to emergency department with an anterior shoulder dislocation () after a ski fall without loss of consciousness. At the initial management, the patient did not show any neurological dysfunction or pulse deficit. The first reduction attempts were unsuccessful and the patient was put under general anesthesia before trying again. During the new attempt to reduce the shoulder dislocation, we observed the occurrence of a hematoma in the deltopectoral region (). At the same time, loss of palpable peripheral pulse and upper limb ischemia appeared. A CT scan was performed and showed a compressive hematoma in the axillary region, a disruption of the axillary artery flow, and a bilateral pulmonary embolism (previously unknown). The patient was transferred to a university hospital to be supported by vascular and trauma surgeons. The patient was still under general anesthesia. The dislocation was successfully reduced in the operating room. Upper limb ischemia with persistent pulseless and cold arm led to an emergency vascular management. The humeral artery was dissected through the brachial tunnel and a thromboembolectomy was done. An arteriography was performed due to the persistence of pulsatile hematoma, which revealed a disruption of the axillary artery with extravasation of contrast near the humeral head (). An angioplasty balloon was introduced to control the proximal bleeding. After the introduction of the occlusion balloon, an incision was performed at the pectoralis major muscle and the hematoma was decompressed. The artery was deteriorated over about 1 cm and an end-to-end anastomosis was performed. The bilateral pulmonary embolism was probably due to the compression of the axillary vein during the shoulder dislocation. Nevertheless, no examination has confirmed this hypothesis. The patient received an intravenous anticoagulant therapy by heparin and then by an oral anticoagulant. Postoperatively, Doppler ultrasound showed a good morphologic and hemodynamic result. Concerning the functional outcome, the patient did not have neurological or vascular complications in the postoperative period.

He was otherwise well, though was currently unable to perform any activities that involved prolonged weight bearing and found it increasingly difficult to continue his occupation within allied health care.\nThe patient noted an initial diagnosis of OCD at age 13. This was appropriately treated conservatively with a period of reduced load and protected weight bearing. He was later able to return to sport - which included Australian Rules football.\nDue to recurrence of pain he underwent arthroscopic examination at age 14. Arthroscopic probing of the OCD lesion indicated that it was stable and conservative management and further unloading was pursued. The patient failed conservative management and 1 year later underwent a repeat arthroscopy at which time an unstable 3 cm × 3 cm lesion involving his medial femoral condyle was removed. It was felt that as the fragment had little subchondral bone that direct repair was not achievable. A further arthroscopy was performed 8 months later and a chondral biopsy was taken for later autologous chondrocyte transplantation. At the time it was noted that no healing had occurred at the site of the defect.\nTwo months later, the treating surgeon, using a lateral arthrotomy approach, patched the defect using a matrix induced autologous chondrocyte implant (MACI). The patch was fixed in place using fibrin glue. One year later, and due to persistent discomfort and swelling of the knee, the patient underwent a further arthroscopy. It was noted that the outer rim of the MACI patch had incorporated well, yet an inner area of 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm had failed to fill completely.\nAt age 23 and due to troubling discomfort and mechanical features of instability the patient underwent another arthroscopy.

The ophthalmologic examination showed a bilateral constriction of the visual field and a slight reduction in the visual acuity on the right side. A magnetic resonance of the brain and a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) disclosed a giant partially thrombosed aneurysm of the ICA on the right side (). Although there is no randomized evidence showing that the FDs are superior to the conventional treatment options, the FD option was considered for the following reasons: the paraclinoid ICA represents one of the best targets for such devices [], there were no anatomical limitations to a correct deployment, and, by inducing aneurysm shrinkage, it might have been possible to relieve the mass effect on the optic pathways []. The ophthalmic aneurysm was initially loosely coiled and then a Pipeline FD was placed in the parent artery across the aneurysm neck (). The FD was well deployed and the landing zone extended from the supraclinoid ICA to the cavernous ICA (). There was only a mild focal narrowing at the level of the distal ring where the ICA was compressed by the bulk of the aneurysms against the clinoid process (). The visual acuity deteriorated acutely on both sides despite corticosteroids. The patient was discharged home after 7 days with double antiplatelet medication (75 mg of clopidogrel and 100 mg of aspirin per day). Three months after the procedure, in concomitance with the cessation of the clopidogrel, she acutely developed a hemiparesis on the left side that lasted 48 hours.

The patient had since been free of tumour recurrence until presentation.\nA recent chest X-ray showed a suspicious shadow in the right lower lobe of the lung . Two computer tomography examinations of the chest (fig ) were performed but could not conclusively rule out the possibility of metastasis. It was diagnosed initially as an inflammatory process of the lung. When the shadow failed to change with time further investigations were ordered. This was when a tumour in the right atrium was discovered which was neither haemodynamically nor clinically relevant. Magnetic resonance imaging of the chest showed a spherical tumour (28 × 27 × 20 mm) attached to the wall of the right atrium. The T1 weighted image revealed homogenous signal intensity as well as a loss of signal due to fat tissue. The tumour didn't show any signs of contrast medium uptake so that the diagnosis of a benign lipoma was made preoperatively. Transthoracic echocardiography excluded heart valve dysfunction and confirmed the presence of a mass in the right atrium.\nOn account of the above-mentioned criteria and of the absence of metastasis of the melanoma excision of the lipoma as well as a biopsy of the mass in the right lower lobe was planned. The patient was clinically stable. Heart rate, blood pressure, ECG and lab results were normal with the exception of urea & electrolytes. After careful preparations the lipoma excision was carried out through incision of the right atrium while the patient was supported by cardiopulmonary bypass. The tumour was walnut-sized, yellow, had a smooth surface"}

The patient had been treated with antibiotics, but as that treatment had not proved successful, she was referred to our clinic. In addition, a passed or congenital disease was not specified in the patient's medical history. Clinical examination revealed severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation and submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region. The patient's skin was of normal color and appearance. In the oral examination, the right mandibular first molar tooth was found to have a deep caries cavity and to not be mobile. The other parts of the oral mucosa were normal. The radiographic examination revealed a deep caries cavity and a radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. There was also a lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible as well as at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus, showing focal new bone formation (). When the axial and cross sections were evaluated during the examination with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a tunnel-like defect was identified in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, starting from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth.

The condition has started as an erythematous patch and has developed over a period of 2 years as a fistula to the current size. On palpation, margins were non tender. All surrounding tissues appeared normal in color and texture. When the patient was asked to gargle water, it escaped through his nose. The maxillary occlusal radiograph showed the loss of bone from mid palate region []. Patient's medical history was uneventful, and blood investigations were within normal limits. Serological investigations also showed a negative report for venereal diseases. The patient was advised to discontinue the denture immediately, and the surgery was planned by preferring the palatal rotational flap.\nThe surgical closure of palatal fistula planned under general anesthesia. It was induced by nasotracheal intubation. Patient placed in the supine position and neck extension achieved by keeping a pillow under the shoulder. Local anesthesia with adrenaline was injected around the lesion for hemostasis. The margins of the fistula were excised to remove the epithelial lining. A palatal flap design was planned based upon the course of the greater palatine artery and marked according to the site and size of the defect []. A partial thickness flap was raised and rotated laterally to cover the defect []. The flap was then secured in its new place using 3–0 black silk sutures [].

Clinical examination revealed that the superior limb was articulating with the shoulder joint, and the inferior limb laterally attached to the chest wall. Both these limbs on the right side were hypoplastic compared to the left upper limb. The superior limb was approximately 7 cm shorter than the opposite limb (normal side), the superior limb being 33 cm in length from the shoulder joint while the inferior limb was 18 cm from the attachment with the chest wall. The skin over the forearm on the superior limb was shiny and atrophic with very little soft tissue mass compared with the inferior limb which was bulkier with normal-appearing skin. The superior limb was articulating with the torso via a normal shoulder joint. The scapula was small compared to that on the opposite side. The inferior limb was attached to the lateral thoracic wall by soft tissue at the level of the 4th intercostal space. The superior limb had a humerus, a single bone at the forearm level, and a duplicated thumb with an index finger. There was synostosis at the elbow joint and the wrist joint was stable. All fingers showed symphalyngism; the middle ray including the 3rd metacarpal was absent. The inferior limb had two fingers and a single bone with which it was attached to the chest wall. Clinically, the superior limb presented a picture of an ulnar hypoplastic hand where there was a stable wrist joint and a fused elbow joint. The inferior limb presented like a radial club hand with instability of the wrist joint.

A 27 year old female runner was initially part of an experimental study documenting the muscle onset timing of the posterior leg and trunk muscles during the prone leg extension. At the time of the study the participant had no leg or spine injuries. The participant was part of the asymptomatic control group. Five months after the completion of the study this participant suffered an inversion right ankle sprain during a rainstorm while leaping into a camping tent filled with children. At 2 and 8 weeks post ankle sprain the PLE extension test was performed while recording the posterior muscle activation EMG to determine if an ankle injury influences the timing of muscle activation during the PLE as compared with an injury-free PLE onset timing pattern.\nTwenty seven year old female distance runner (height – 167 cm, weight -58 kg) suffered a right ankle inversion sprain. X rays revealed no fractures. Informed consent to participate in this study was received from the subject. In the initial study the participant read and signed an information and consent form that was approved by the Research Ethics Board of CMCC. For the second half of the study the subject was notified of the risks and benefits of the study which complied with the World Medical Association declaration of Helsinki on the ethical conduct of research using human participants within a private practice and agreed to have her results published.\nNo passive therapy was received by the participant.

{"note": "A 11 years old male was referred to the emergency department of Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital due to a slight periodontal bleeding of 5 days of evolution. An orthopantomography was performed to focus the diagnosis. The OPG evidenced a dubious periapical image compatible with a small cyst of dental origin. Hence, the doctors of the emergency service decided to contact with the maxillofacial surgery department. A new clinical examination evidenced a spontaneous alveolar bleeding and high mobility of the first and second molars of the fourth mandibular quadrant. The patient denied cervicofacial trauma or pathologies of the coagulation system. Thus, a CT scan of the cervicofacial area was performed to reach a diagnosis. Surprisingly, this test evidenced a large high-flow intraosseous arteriovenous malformation extending from the right mandibular body to the homolateral pterygoid region and the infratemporal fossa (Fig. ). Moreover, a selective arteriography and a MRI of head and neck were also carried out to identify the limits of the malformation and the key vessel (Fig. ). Considering these findings, we contacted with the interventional radiology unit of the Hospital in order to plan a combined approach. However, after a careful analysis we decided to treat the patient only with an endovascular approach. Specifically, a very large drainage vein was identified with the radiological tests. Hence, we hypothesized that the embolization of this vein and the selective embolization of the main arterial vessels might be enough to treat the pathology. Thus, under general anesthesia and femoral approach, the embolization of the main drainage vein and of the most accessible arteries was carried out. The patient was maintained intubated and sedated for 24 hours and he was extubated when the bleeding had completely stopped. He was discharged from the hospital 7 days after the procedure. In fact, a control arteriography performed 5 day after embolization showed a significant reduction of the size of the lesion. A MRI performed three months after the procedure evidenced the complete regression of the lesion. Furthermore, in a new control 18 month after the patient has no clinical"}
{"note": "A 64-year-old gentleman with a post radiation recurrent squamous carcinoma of the left lower alveolus was posted for composite resection and reconstruction with fibula free flap by simultaneous two team approach. The left fibula was selected and after flap harvest, the left neck vessels (superior thyroid and facial) were assessed for the volume and character of the flow and were found to be good. The bone defect was extending from midline anteriorly to proximal ramus posteriorly and the soft-tissue defect was confined to the oral cavity []. The flap was designed in a manner so that the superior thyroid vessels were to be used as donor vessels as they were away from the previous zone of irradiation and the blood flow was also good after dissecting them and dividing to look for the volume and adequacy of blood flow. After osteotomy and preliminary intra oral in setting of the skin paddle, and during the time of anastomosis, it was found that the flow in the superior thyroid artery was inadequate after initial good flow. Routine measures such as application of warm saline, xylocaine solution and later papaverine did not improve the flow and in such a situation, the options available were\nTo open the right neck and use vessels from that side either directly or with a vein graft To use a vein graft and anastomose with the facial artery on the same (left) side as the flow in this vessel was good To use the distal end of the flap pedicle vessels for anastomosis with left facial artery, so as to establish the vascular flow in a retrograde manner. This was because the clipped distal ends of the peroneal pedicle vessels were near to the left facial artery.\nBefore exploring the opposite neck or harvesting a vein graft, a decision was made to attempt retrograde vascularisation of the flap via the distal end of the peroneal vessels. First, the arterial anastomosis was completed between the distal end of the peroneal artery and left facial artery (end-to-end) and the flow was checked. The arterial flow"}

The symptom was constant and worsened with menstruation, standing or walking for more than 30 min. The pain was relieved by elevating the leg in the sitting position or massaging the calf muscles. The pain was not associated with any progressive neurologic symptoms or signs. She reported that none of the medications she had tried provided any significant pain relief. Intramuscular electrical stimulation for 4 months and repeated muscle injections with lidocaine were also ineffective. Alternative treatments including acupuncture and Korean herbal medications had been tried many times without much success.\nThe patient's pain drawing showed a pain pattern limited to the left calf, especially in the medial side, which indicated a referred pain pattern of medial gastrocnemius or soleus muscle (). Physical examination revealed severe tenderness on the medial side of the left calf muscles. Signs of calf swelling were equivocal. Deep tendon reflexes were normal in both sides. Muscle strength of both lower extremities was normal. Sensation in both lower extremities was intact. The straight leg raising test was normal. Conventional radiography of the left leg showed several mottled calcifications within the muscles but did not reveal erosions of tibia or fibula (). To rule out a possible vascular deformity, femoral angiography was performed and a hemangioma was suggested in the left calf (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left lower extremity was performed for further evaluation of these abnormalities and showed an enhancing soft-tissue mass in the medial aspect of the soleus muscle ().\nThe patient was referred to an orthopedic surgeon and underwent excisional biopsy.

He had sharp pain initially when he first developed the abnormality but had been asymptomatic ever since. He did not recall any inciting factors. He was concerned that a previously repaired right inguinal hernia had recurred from its original tissue repair in 1977. Details of the original right inguinal hernia repair were unknown to the patient, other than no implantation of mesh occurred. On physical examination, a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to elucidate the cause of the mass in his groin (Figs. , , and ). The imaging was relevant for a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 109/L. The patient elected to proceed with surgical intervention for hernia repair.\nThe patient presented to the hospital setting for his elective right inguinal hernia repair. A classic oblique incision was made in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. The external oblique aponeurosis was opened and the hernia isolated and examined. The hernia was noted to be comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum that had a chronic, scarred appearance. The base of the appendix could be seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity. Initially, there was no indication to perform an appendectomy at the time of the procedure if the appendix could be successfully reduced into the abdominal cavity. However, the chronic appearing adhesions in the area prevented this step. In order to reduce the appendix at that point, a relaxing incision was then made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum entered"}

She had no other obvious sequelae from the subarachnoid hemorrhage and her medical condition was quite stable with the shunt. Her breasts were large and drooping (), and left nipple areola sparing mastectomy was scheduled. A preoperative computed tomography scan showed the shunt tube, which pierced the intervertebral lumbar and traveled through the subcutaneous layer of the left trunk () and entered into the abdominal cavity from the outer edge of the left rectus abdominal muscle ().\nIn the selection of the reconstruction method, we thought that abdominal flap would be suitable because implant reconstruction would not achieve morphologically favorable results and because a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap would not have sufficient volume. However, it was considered that the shunt tube might cause difficulty in the elevation of the flaps.\nWe consulted brain surgeons on the feasibility of the abdominal flap operation and decided to withdraw the tube from the abdominal cavity once, when the flap was elevated, and to reinsert it upon the closure of the donor site. The patient consented to our preoperative explanation of the procedure and indicated that she desired to undergo DIEP flap reconstruction.\nShe underwent nipple areola sparing mastectomy of the left breast and immediate DIEP flap reconstruction. In the elevation of the flap, a skin incision was first made around the whole circumference of the flap and dissection was carried down to the muscle fascia.

A few months after the injury, he noticed a small growth on the left side of the upper gums that progressively increased slowly to the present size. There was a sudden surge in growth 20 days before presentation to our department after the patient removed a tooth fragment sticking to the growth. There was a gross asymmetry of face caused by the diffuse swelling involving the lower two-third of the left side of the face. Superoinferiorly, it extended from the infraorbital region to the lower border of the mandible and the anteroposterior extent was from the midline to the left preauricular region.

Periosteum was seen exposed in lower third of tibia and wound was badly contaminated. Radiographs of the leg showed a distal third tibia fracture with a segmental piece of tibia which was further comminuted. The fibula fracture was at the same level as tibia and was short oblique fracture. Patient presented immediately after the injury and debridement was done within 2 hours of injury. A thorough wash was given with debridement of all dead and devitalized tissue. Fracture was fixed using a biplanar external fixator (). Wound dressing was done regularly and intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics were given. Two further debridements were needed and at 4 weeks the wound was healthy enough to perform a cross leg flap. At 3 weeks post flap surgery, the external fixator was removed due to multiple pin track infections and the limb was immobilized in a long leg cast. At 3 and half months post injury the wound was healthy.

{"note": "A 71-year old man was referred to our clinic for the sudden onset back pain with weakness in both legs and sensory change. The pain was located at mid thoracic area, and was positively related to motion. It started 5 days prior to the visit and the neurologic changes occurred the following day. Neurologic examination revealed grade IV motor power on both legs and hypoesthesia was present below the level of the xiphoid process. The patient was able to walk with the aid of a cane. He had been taking anti-arrhythmic medications for a year, and had no other past medical history.\nPlain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken from the other hospital revealed a T8 acute compression fracture with cord compression (). Under an impression of the T8 pathologic fracture, we ran a series of tests to find the primary origin of the spinal metastasis. All laboratory tests including tumor markers were within normal limits. Chest and abdominal computed tomography scans did not show any mass lesions in solid organs. We discussed the plan for diagnosis with oncologists. Since the patient presented with neurologic symptoms in both lower extremities, we came to an agreement that planning an early spine surgery of T8 decompression and stabilization and making the pathologic diagnosis through tumor tissue removed during the surgery would be reasonable. Further systemic work ups such as whole body positron emission tomography was planned after confirmation of the pathologic diagnosis. No steroid therapy was performed during the preoperative period.\nA spinal embolization was performed prior to the operation. As a small size of the ASA was visualized on the left T8 segmental artery angiography (), only the right T8 segmental artery was embolized. On the following day, we carried out a total laminectomy of T8 and pedicle screw fixation from T6 to T10. Tumors located at the ventral side of the dura sac were partially removed to achieve circumferential decompression of the spinal cord. For this procedure, we resected both T8 roots. The operation was uneventful. No significant changes were observed on neurophysiologic intraoperative"}

Routine chemistry and tumor marker levels (CA 19-9, CEA, CA 125) were all within normal limits. Abdominal CT scan and EUS showed about 5×4 cm sized, slightly septated cystic tumor between the body and tail of the pancreas (). There was no mural nodule, no calcification, and no eccentrically located mass within the cystic area. The benign mucinous cystic tumor of the pancreas was the most favorable preoperative diagnosis. The operation sequence was similar to usual laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy except trocar placement (). The robotic camera arm and other three instrument arms were then connected to their respective ports. At this point, the surgeon sat at the surgical console located about 3 m from the operating table. The assistant surgeon was positioned on the patient's left side for temporary use of laparoscopic instruments through Port 4. In spite of our previous experiences of robot surgical system, the cystic tumor and the remaining splenic vessels were so closely adherent that bleeding was frequently encountered, and most operation time was spent for this process. The risk of cyst rupture was also considered when we tried to separate and divide the small splenic vessels from pancreatic cyst (). Therefore, concomitant segmental resection of splenic vessels was thought to be necessary for spleen preservation. Total operation took about 480 minutes, and about 800 mL of blood loss was noted without blood transfusion. The specimen was delivered through the umbilical port site with small vertical incision after putting into the plastic bag. The patient recovered without complication. She returned to an oral diet on the postoperative second day. After the drain was removed, she was discharged on the fifth day post-operation. The final pathologic examination revealed that the tumor was benign mucinous cystic neoplasm without any characteristics of malignant potential (). A color doppler ultrasound scan obtained 14 days after surgery showed no evidence of splenic infarction and well preserved blood flow within the spleen without definitive peripancreatic fluid collection ("}

She denied angina, palpitations, syncope or any other associated symptoms and did not have any cardiovascular disease risk factors. On examination, she was stable and in no distress. Her blood pressure was 148/66 mmHg with a regular pulse of 48 beats per minute. She had no clinical evidence of heart failure on cardiovascular examination but was found to have an S4 on auscultation and cannon A waves on assessment of her jugular venous pressure (JVP). Her exam was otherwise unremarkable. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram during the clinic visit revealed complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm at 49 beats per minute with right bundle branch block morphology; her 12-lead electrocardiogram 3 months earlier also revealed evidence of underlying conduction disease with a prolonged PR interval and right bundle branch block while in sinus rhythm. Trans-thoracic echocardiography displayed normal left ventricular size and function with mild degenerative changes of the mitral and aortic valves consistent with age related changes. There was no laboratory evidence of any metabolic or ischemic etiologies for the conduction disease. Given her age, clinical presentation, underlying conduction disease in the setting of no significant structural abnormalities on echocardiography, and lack of significant comorbidities, the patient likely had age related degenerative conduction disease. Significant coronary artery disease could not be excluded but was very unlikely given the lack of ischemic symptoms and cardiovascular disease risk factors along with normal cardiac size and function. She was arranged to have a permanent pacemaker implant for the symptomatic complete heart block and will have further risk stratification for possible coronary artery disease following the pacemaker implantation.The patient was brought to the operating theater following informed consent.

The vertebral lesion was situated on the left transverse process and was separated from the spinal canal (Fig. ). Biopsy specimens of both lesions were histologically similar and showed spindle cell neoplasms with a bland appearance; however, we could not make a definitive diagnosis, owing to the small size of the samples.

{"note": "A 84-year-old female was scheduled for bilateral total hip replacement due to osteoarthritis of both hips (). Medical history included chronic Hepatitis C virus infection with no other medical conditions reported. The patient was allowed to decide which hip would be performed first. 5 months after scheduling, the patient was admitted for surgery arriving in a wheelchair, and new pelvis radiographs were taken (). Other causes of the rapid destruction of the hip joint were ruled out, and the patient was diagnosed of bilateral RDO. Keeping in mind a possible septic etiology, despite there was no history of septicemia and inflammatory markers were elevated due to chronic hepatitis, we decided to take samples for microbiology and histology during the procedures. The right hip was performed through an anterior approach by a senior surgeon following standard antibiotic prophylaxis with 2 g of cefazolin 20 min before skin incision. An uncemented prosthesis was implanted with no complications. Femoral head destruction led to an important defect in the posterior and superior wall of the acetabulum. This conditioned high and medial implantation of the cup to achieve stability. 4 days after the first procedure was performed, one out of six cultures was positive for Enterococcus faecium with no local and systemic signs of infection or pain. Synovial biopsy revealed fibrosis, chronic inflammation, calcifications, macrophages, and osteoclast giant cells with no signs of acute inflammation. Urine cultures were negative. The Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria [] were not met and the patient did not receive antibiotic treatment. 6 days later, after a favorable post-operative evolution, the left hip was performed through a posterior approach by a different senior surgeon with the same hip system but with a cemented stem (). In the left hip, the acetabulum was also affected by the bone destruction, but the cup was able to be placed at a correct height. This ended up with a leg length discrepancy that is well tolerated by the patient taking into account her previous functional status. 5 days after the second procedure and following a post-operative period without complications"}
{"note": "A 60 year old male presented with Staphylococcus aureous infection of his endocardial pacing system. His past medical history was remarkable for mild dilated cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia, a biventricular endocardial pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy, and several previous percutaneous endocardial pacing system implantations via the right and the left subclavian veins. The pacing leads and box were removed and the infection was treated with antibiotics. Due to subclavian vein stenosis and pacing box pocket infection, transvenous approach for implantation of a new pacing system proved not to be feasible. Therefore he was referred for surgical implantation of a new epicardial pacing system.\nA lower half limited median sternotomy was performed starting from the xiphoid process, up to the level of the third intercostal space. A second limited transverse sternotomy was performed starting from the left third intercostal space and joining the midline sternotomy (Figure ). The pericardium was opened in the midline, providing excellent exposure and easy access to both the right atrial appendage and the right ventricle. The right atrial leads were sutured to the surface of the right atrial appendage, while the right ventricular bipolar leads were sutured to the anterior muscular part of the right ventricle. Access to the left ventricle was achieved by gently lifting up the heart, using an epicardial tissue stabilizing system and exposing the lateral wall of the left ventricle with no hemodynamic compromise. The left ventricular lead was screwed into the proximal part of the lateral wall between the obtuse marginal arteries and then the defibrillator patch was sutured to the distal lateral wall. It was made sure that there was a good orientation between the patch and the pacing box which was subsequently inserted in the sheath of the right rectus muscle. The thresholds on the pacing leads were checked and the defibrillating patch was tested. A right subcostal incision was made and a pocket was created in the lateral side of the right rectus muscle. The pacing wires were tunneled between the right hemi-diaphragm and the lateral edge of the right rectus muscle, into"}
{"note": "At the time of diagnosis this patient was a 9 year-old female with a one year history of pain and swelling about her left knee. She had experienced a fall and related all symptoms to the fall. She was seen in her local emergency room by her family physician; there was no diagnosis or treatment. Approximately one month prior to her representation, she was struck in the left knee by a basketball and developed worsening pain. She was seen by an orthopedic surgeon (December 1999) and was noted to have a valgus posture of both lower extremities, exaggerated on the left by external rotation and she walked with a mild limp. The left knee had no effusion but was hypersensitive to light touch over the lateral aspect where there was soft tissue swelling just below the knee. There was no obvious mass in the area, although firm palpation was difficult because of patient discomfort. Plain films were normal and an MR was ordered that revealed an apparent meniscal cyst in the lateral aspect of the left knee [Figure ]. Biopsy of the cystic structure was performed (November 1999) that revealed a high-grade synovial cell sarcoma. Metastatic work-up consisting of nuclear bone scan and CT of the chest were negative. Amputation was offered by the local care team that included a radiation oncologist because of their concern about possible contamination of the joint space and uncertain functional outcome. The patient was referred to St. Jude Children's Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nAt the time of her evaluation after referral (January 2000), there was a well healed scar with no excessive swelling. There was mild tenderness on the lateral aspect of her left knee. Additional imaging studies showed abnormality at the site of prior surgery equivocal for residual tumor. There was no evidence of abnormality in the joint space. The tumor bed was explored. There was no physical evidence of compromise at the level of the joint space. She underwent wide local excision with placement of afterloading catheters. Six catheters were placed in a parallel"}

The patient did not have any relevant comorbidities and her general status was good. The patient underwent a total left hip arthroplasty at the age of seventy four due to severe osteoarthritis pain that hindered baseline activities. Eight years later, the patient presented to the orthopedics department with a progressive pain in the affected hip, particularly when walking, causing difficulties in deambulation.\nAn X ray examination revealed an extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of the femoral component, and an MRI showed a femoral pseudo-tumor (bone proliferation). With this finding, a revision total hip arthroplasty was performed with the insertion of a reconstruction ring with cemented dual mobility cups. Three weeks after this last surgery, the patient started with early symptoms of infection (high fever, suppuration, no wound healing and laboratory abnormalities); an attempt at conservative management with intravenous antibiotic, irrigation and suction drainages was unsuccessful and a replacement of the endoprosthesis femur in two stages was planned.\nIn the first stage, the previous prosthesis was removed with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity and a cement spacer with antibiotic was placed. Two months later, the spacer was removed and a new coated silver total femoral prosthesis was placed.

She was noted to have moderate liver function abnormalities (ALT 3 times normal range) during a medical evaluation. After extensive evaluation of her liver dysfunction no apparent causes were found. She did not drink alcohol or take any medications, and was of normal body weight. Infectious, obstructive and autoimmune causes were ruled out. She was noted to consume a number of dietary supplements and referred to our clinic to address dietary supplement polyherbacy and its potential affect on her liver function tests. She brought all her supplements for review. At that evaluation, we addressed the purpose of her use of each supplement ().\nShe reported adding more and more dietary supplements over the years, as she read extensively and frequently researched the internet for information on these products. Ultimately she felt at a loss as to which supplements might be of benefit or which supplements to stop taking. This patient typically would use less than the recommended dose noted on the label, but at times would use a higher than recommended dose. She also would vary which supplement she might use in any given day. She expressed concern that her dietary supplement intake had gotten out of control and felt she may be addicted to using supplements as they gave her a greater sense of control.\nAfter discussing the purpose for using each dietary supplement and concerns with dietary supplement polypharmacy and its potential effect on her liver dysfunction, she agreed to stop all supplements for the time being, with the exception of calcium and vitamin D, and one multivitamin a day. Until her follow-up visit she would increase her dietary intake of antioxidant foods, acidophilus and omega 3 fatty acids in place of her supplements, and practice mind-body techniques and exercise for health and stress reduction.

She reported having an episode of sudden onset severe headache associated with generalized tonic and clonic fits and loss of consciousness. She regained consciousness after a period of 24 h without any neurological deficit with a complaint of neck rigidity and headache. The patient had a past history of similar episodes dating back 1 year. Upon interview she recalled a long history of trivial headaches, malaise and low grade fever for the past 6 years, whose severity had never warranted any further investigation. She also had a history of intermittent claudication in her bilateral upper limbs. Physical examination revealed no neurological deficit, however, radial and brachial arteries were impalpable bilaterally. Right to left blood pressure discrepancies were detected, measuring at 140/80 from right arm and 160/80 from the left arm.\nA CT brain was conducted that revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular extension (). Similar findings were evident in previous CT scan brain which was done 1 year ago at the previous presentation of ictus (). Laboratory investigation showed raised ESR upto 40 mm/h and C Reactive Protein was positive. Cerebral angiography and aortogram showed total occlusion of left common carotid artery from its origin and 90% occlusion of right common carotid artery from its origin with slightly dilated segment prior to its tapering (). The sole arteries supplying the intracranial circulation were bilateral vertebral arteries and showed saccular basilar tip aneurysm of size 7.30 x 5.39 mm (). Additional imaging showed bilateral occlusion of subclavian arteries from their initial segments. There were extensive collateral branches to intercostal arteries supplying both upper arms (). The terminal aorta was irregular but bilateral renal arteries and other branches of aorta were normal (). We started the patient on 20 mg prednisone resulting in a reduction of ESR as well as normalization of C Reactive Protein. Further the patient was referred for endovascular coil embolization as vertebral arteries were relatively straight and easy to access."}

Progressive atrophy on the left half of the face was initially noticed at the age of 8 years as an area of hyper pigmentation on the left malar area which gradually progressed with resultant atrophy of the underlying fat and subcutaneous tissue resulting in the present disfigurement (Fig. ). However it was not associated with any other symptoms except for the limited mouth opening which the patient experienced gradually as the condition progressed. The patient had not sought any consultation earlier, for the facial disfigurement. Her medical and family history was non contributory. On general physical examination patient was conscious, oriented, a febrile, general condition was fair and vital signs were stable. Right side of the face appeared normal with marked facial asymmetry noted on left side. Head and neck examination confirmed the asymmetry with flattening, hyperpigmented, parchment like overlying skin. There was an evident loss of underlying fat, muscle and subcutaneous tissue giving a sunken in appearance. Thinning of the lips on the affected side with exposition of the teeth due to the corner of the mouth pulled to left side. Ocular examination and skin examination showed no abnormality with any evidence of lymphadenopathy. There was no evidence of sensory or motor deficits on both sides. On palpation, the skin on the affected side was rigid with signs of sclerosis. TMJ on the affected side was tender with deviation to the left on mouth opening. Intraoral examination revealed normal moist mucosa but tense oral mucosa on the affected side. Tongue on the affected side showed marked atrophy on the left side with shift in the dorsal median fissure (Fig. ).

By the time he reached the emergency room, the pain had reached 8 out of a maximum of10 in intensity. The pain was precipitated and aggravated by a stressful situation at home. It radiated to his left shoulder and was not relieved by rest. Patient had a five pack-year history of smoking but quit 10 years ago. He would occasionally drink alcohol. On further questioning, the patient revealed that he had been having mild left sided chest pains, sharp in nature and similar to the current episode, for the last few months. The pain would occur either with stress or exertion. He did not seek medical attention before because the pain would be transient and go away on its own after a few minutes. He was not on any medications and did not use any pain relieving medicines either for his prior symptoms.\nIn the emergency room, patient was in mild distress and had a blood pressure of 165/81, something new for him. All the rest of the vital signs were normal and both the cardiac and pulmonary examination did not reveal any abnormality either. The basic laboratory work up was normal except a lipid profile showing elevated cholesterol of 238 mg/dl. The patient had an electrocardiogram that showed some premature supraventricular complexes without any ischemic changes. Cardiac biomarkers including serial troponin-I were also normal. The chest pain subsided in the emergency room with intravenous morphine. The patient was admitted to the hospital in the telemetry unit. He was found to have some runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia while in the hospital.

Nevertheless, a slowly growing mass occurred in his popliteal fossa in a year following being subjected to the puncture wound. He resorted to cardiovascular surgery department in another hospital and Doppler ultrasonography together with arteriography was taken. A popliteal pseudoaneurysm was detected in the distal part of the popliteal artery near the bifurcation to the anterior and posterior tibial arteries and was about 4 cm in diameter (). The patient was taken into operation by cardiovascular surgeons after the angiography. He had an excision of the pseudoaneurysm and primary repair surgery to popliteal artery. After surgery, the popliteal artery was patent according to Doppler USG. He had a foot drop after the operation which resolves spontaneously after a year. At early follow-up, a gradually expanding mass recurred in the popliteal fossa. He went to cardiovascular surgery with this complain, but observation was recommended. Monophasic flow was seen on the popliteal artery according to Doppler ultrasonography which was taken 5 years after the operation. He resorted to some medical centers for his swelling to be treated during 10 years after bypass surgery, but observation without any interference was suggested according to the patient's momentary condition. He applied to our department with a huge popliteal mass associated with obstructed popliteal artery.\nOn the physical examination of the patient, there was a large mass (28 × 10 cm) in the popliteal fossa with old surgical scars.

His past medical history included CAD with prior stenting of the left circumflex artery, diabetes with a HbA1c of 5.7 and an 80-pack year smoking history. He reported a 37 kg unintentional weight loss over 6 months with postprandial abdominal pain and nausea. In addition, he had exertional angina relieved by rest and sublingual nitrates. He had an abdominal CT scan for evaluation of the hernia, and this demonstrated severe atherosclerotic abdominal aortic disease with occlusion of the origin of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries and patency of the inferior mesenteric artery. This was confirmed by mesenteric angiography which demonstrated occlusion of the celiac and SMA with a large mesenteric collateral originating from the inferior mesenteric artery (). This artery had a 90% orifice stenosis. With his cardiac history and symptoms, he underwent coronary angiography, which demonstrated significant left main and 3-vessel CAD (). Left ventricular function was preserved with no valvular heart disease by transthoracic echocardiography.\nHe was referred initially for evaluation for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and reported a brief episode of slurred speech in the past 2 months. A carotid duplex was obtained and showed 80–99% left internal carotid artery stenosis and 50–79% right internal carotid artery stenosis. Given his severe symptomatic carotid and mesenteric arterial disease, there would be significantly greater risk of neurological and mesenteric ischemic complications associated with CABG. The decision was made to perform surgical revascularization to address each vascular system in a staged and combined manner.\nThe patient underwent uncomplicated left carotid endarterectomy and was admitted postoperatively. He had no neurologic complications and was taken for combined CABG and mesenteric bypass on the fourth postoperative day. After induction of anesthesia and placement of hemodynamic monitoring lines, the procedure was initiated with a median sternotomy and mobilization of the left internal mammary artery as a pedicled graft.

The patient had noticed these swellings of the calf muscle a few years ago without any traumatic history. He had no pain at night and no fever or medical illness. The past medical history of the patient was uneventful.\nOn physical examination the soleus muscle was swollen on both sides. The swelling was localized on the right leg over the whole soleus muscle, 10 by 3 cm. On the left lower leg the swelling was about 3 by 3 cm over the medial part of the soleus muscle. A dimpling in both legs (right more than left) at the medial calf area was seen while standing (Figure ). There was full strength in all lower leg muscles and the reflexes were normal on examination. The rest of the examination was unremarkable, the overlying skin appeared normal without deformities, erythema or warmth and the arterial pulsations were intact. Laboratory test results did not show any abnormalities. An X-ray did not show any bony irregularities in the tibia.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the legs revealed bilateral multiple saccular intramuscular venous malformations involving the soleus muscle (Figure ). There was no nidus seen on MRI so an arteriovenous form of the malformation was not plausible. Due to its asymptomatic presentation no angiogram or ultrasonography was performed to further specify the lesion.

{"note": "An 18-year-old American college football player presented with a vague headache since he was tackled during exercise several weeks ago. Brain computed tomography (CT) was performed at a local hospital a few days before visiting our hospital because the headache worsened and was not relieved through medication. Initial brain CT revealed a small amount of subdural hematoma on the left cerebral convexity (). Few calcified nodules were noted at the left frontotemporal cortex. However, it was initially considered a simple traumatic hemorrhage and was managed by conservative means. Several days later, the headache aggravated and the patient experienced an episode of generalized partial seizure. On the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed immediately after the seizure, the size of acute hematoma and cerebral edema was markedly increased, and a small enhancing mass was observed at the left cerebral convexity (). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed a 4 mm sized aneurysmal dilatation of the cortical branch of the MCA, which supplies the superior temporal region (). Emergency craniotomy was performed to eliminate the aneurysm and lower the elevated intracranial pressure by removing the hematoma. A large craniotomy was done, and the subdural hematoma was removed by repeated gentle irrigation and suction after small dural incision. While further opening of the dura, we were encountered by several irregularly shaped, hard subdural nodules which were tightly adhered to the dura and the underlying brain (). Upon careful dissection, these nodules were noted to be buried in the sulcus while being severely adhered to the brain cortex and the cortical arteries. Between the nodules was an organizing hematoma and upon careful removal, a pseudoaneurysm of the cortical MCA branch was exposed. The involved MCA branch was carefully dissected and was trapped by clips at the proximal and distal portion of the severely injured and adherent segment, along with the pseudoaneurysm. The aneurysm and the calcified nodules were then excised. The ischemic injury was minimized because the collateral flow retrogradely supplied the distal part of the occluded artery. The patient recovered without sequelae and was discharged after a short while."}
{"note": "An 82-year-old male presented with a large right IIA aneurysm diagnosed during routine surveillance on a long background history of complicated aortoiliac endovascular intervention. His comorbidities included chronic renal failure, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia. He had undergone an endovascular AAA repair 9 years previously for treatment of a 5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. This treatment was complicated by the subsequent development of bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms. In attempting to endovascularly repair these aneurysms 3 years after the initial surgery, a rupture of the right external iliac artery necessitated placement of a covered stent across the origin of the right internal iliac artery and into the body of the main aortic endograft. Ongoing surveillance of his aortoiliac system with duplex ultrasound demonstrated the gradual development of bilateral IIA aneurysms. A dedicated CT angiogram performed 6 years after the IIA origin was covered showing the sac having expanded to a diameter 6.4 cm. The source of expansion was thought to be a type II endoleak from collaterals originating in left iliac system. Endovascular embolisation of these vessels was attempted via a left sided femoral artery puncture, with angiography demonstrating the origin of the endoleak being the right superior gluteal artery that was being fed through a plexus of collateral channels through the body of the sacrum. It was not possible to cannulate these vessels with a microcatheter, and therefore endovascular treatment of the endoleak was not possible. The patient was offered an open procedure to manage the enlarging IIA aneurysm, which was declined due to the significant risks in light of the patient's previous abdominal interventions and poor overall health ().\nThe decision was made to treat the aneurysm via direct puncture method employing a posterior approach under CT visualisation. Under general anaesthetic and with the patient in a prone position, CT guidance was used to insert a 17-gauge needle into the right superior gluteal artery. The artery was accessed via a transgluteal approach with the catheter passing through the sciatic notch. Contrast injection in the angiography suite confirmed the catheter to be situated"}
{"note": "A 44-year-old woman was referred to our hospital from a local clinic for decreased visual acuity in her left eye. Two hours before the manifestation of symptoms, an autologous fat injection was administered in the periocular area under intravenous anesthesia. The autologous fat was obtained from the abdominal area and the procedure was performed by a local plastic surgeon. When the effect of the anesthesia wore off, the patient reported a loss of vision in the left eye. The best corrected visual acuity was 1.0 in the right eye and no light perception on the left side. The left pupil was dilated and a relative afferent pupillary defect was detected. During physical examination, the patient suddenly complained of dysarthria and the skin color of the nose changed to purple (). The patient was immediately transferred to the emergency room and neurological examination, blood tests, and an MRI scan of the brain were performed. Within 30 minutes, the dysarthria improved significantly and the patient was able to speak normally. On examination, the right fundus appeared to be normal but the left showed a cherry red spot with visible emboli in several retinal arteries (). Fluorescein angiography of the left eye revealed markedly prolonged choroidal filling around the optic disc and a delay in retinal arterial filling while that of the right eye revealed no abnormalities (). The results of laboratory examinations were normal, however the MRI scan showed an ill-defined hyperintense lesion at the left insular cortex (). The patient was finally diagnosed with ophthalmic artery obstruction and left middle cerebral artery infarction. The patient was promptly administered ocular massage, intravenous mannitolization, and oxygen and carbon dioxide therapy. Twenty-four hours after autologous fat injection, the left fundus exhibited marked retinal edema and multiple fat emboli and the visual acuity of the left eye was no light perception (). At 2 months after the injection, the patient had no perception of light in the left eye and the left fundus showed optic atrophy, multiple retinal hemorrhages, and a fibrous change on its posterior pole ()."}
{"note": "A 55-year-old female presented to the ophthalmology department of the hospital with complaints of a painful swelling in the left eye. The swelling had been gradually increasing in size over the last 8 months with dull continuous pain in the eye and periorbital area. There was progressive diminution of vision for the last 6 months in the affected eye, and at the time of presentation in the hospital, the affected eye was completely blind. The progressive increase in the size of the swelling and pain in and around the eye compelled the patient to avail hospital services. The treatment history was not significant. The patient was being treated by a local doctor with eye drops and certain oral medicines the records of which were not available with her. She did not have any history of significant ocular disease or any ophthalmic surgery. There was no history of similar disease in the family.\nOn examination, an intraorbital mass protruding from the left eye was visible. Axial proptosis with stretched out sclera along with dilated blood vessels covering the entire exposed part of the eye ball was seen. The underlying cornea was barely visible through the widened palpebral aperture with hyperemic keratinized conjunctiva tissue. The swelling was more prominent in the region superior to the upper eye lid. The skin appeared stretched along with dilated vessels in the superior part of the eye ball []. On palpation, the mass was tender and soft in consistency. Fundus examination was not possible because of overlying vascularized keratinized tissue over cornea. The intraocular tension was also not recorded because of these reasons. The status of the pupil of the diseased eye could also not be commented upon, even though it appeared slightly dilated. The patient had no perception of light in the left eye. Ophthalmological examination of the right eye did not show any abnormality both in the anterior as well as in posterior chamber. The fundus examination of the right eye was normal. The intraocular tension of right eye was also normal.\nSystemic examination of the patient"}
{"note": "The patient was a 60-year-old man who referred to our emergency department due to worsening dyspnea and hemoptysis since 2-3 days prior to admission. He reported to have dyspnea and hoarseness during the previous year. He had undergone a direct laryngoscopy which had revealed left vocal cord palsy and a chest computed tomography (CT) scan which had shown a mediastinal mass and with possibility of a malignancy process a direct needle biopsy was done which demonstrated inflammatory cells in the background of blood. His past medical history only included a mild stroke 6 years before without any sequel.\nAt the emergency department he had pulse rate of 86 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18/min and blood pressure of 135/80 mm Hg. He had a continuous murmur in left sternal and pulmonic area and decreased breathing sound in left hemithorax.\nA chest x-ray was obtained which showed a large density in mediastinum and left sided pleural effusion. In echocardiography he had normal left ventricle but dilated right sided chambers with supravalvular pulmonic stenosis. Trans-esophageal echocardiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm of distal aortic arch with clot formation and compression of the main and left pulmonary artery. As a result a chest CT scan with contrast and angiographic construction was done which confirmed the previous finding of a 45 mm × 37 mm pseudoaneurysm in lateral side of aortic arch distal to left subclavian origin with associated 9.5 cm × 10 cm hematoma in mediastinum ( and ). At this stage and upon further investigation he remembered to have fallen down from a few stairs 10 years ago which did not result in any injuries and accordingly he did not seek medical advice.\nThe patient initially refused operation but a few days later developed severe chest pain and so finally agreed to a surgical plan.\nThe patient had a preoperative selective coronary angiography via right radial artery which was normal. He underwent left thoracotomy via femorofemoral bypass. A large pseudoaneurysm of distal aortic arch was detected (). Large hematoma was evacuated from the mediastinum and the aortic wall"}
{"note": "A 38 year old Vietnamese man was admitted with a 10 month history of epigastric pain, fatigue, 10 kg weight loss and recent onset jaundice. He had no other significant medical history. Clinical examination demonstrated anaemia and a tender mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. A computerised tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a 7 × 5 cm thick-walled, complex mass adjacent to the second part of the duodenum, which contained fluid and air and abutted the hepatic flexure of the colon. The working diagnosis was a collection secondary to a colonic perforation and he was treated with intravenous antibiotics. He improved with conservative management and was discharged a month later for outpatient colonoscopy. The colonoscopy revealed a lesion in the transverse colon, histology of which showed a mucinous adenocarcinoma.\nHe subsequently returned to the Accident and Emergency Department following an upper gastrointestinal bleed. On his second admission, a repeat CT scan again suggested localised colonic perforation with formation of an abscess adjacent to the duodenum, along with thickening of the ascending colon, predominantly centred around the hepatic flexure. Given the clinical presentation and diagnostic uncertainty a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed which revealed a large perforated tumour at the hepatic flexure with ascites and peritoneal tumour nodules. A laparotomy was performed via a transverse incision and following mobilisation of the hepatic flexure, a colonic tumour was found to have invaded the gallbladder and duodenum with an abscess cavity anterior to the second part of the duodenum. At the base of the abscess cavity a large hole was apparent in the second part of the duodenum with malignant tumour invading the duodenum. Given the size of the defect (5 cm × 2 cm) and the presence of tumour it was not possible to resect and form a primary closure of the duodenum. The presence of metastatic spread precluded a curative resection by pancreatoduodenectomy.\nA right hemicolectomy was performed to debulk the tumour and an ileotransverse anastamosis formed. Due to the extent of the disease and associated abscess the anterior wall"}
{"note": "An African American male in his 50s presented with increased shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, and orthopnea. He has a past medical history of coronary artery disease with multiple myocardial infarctions and two coronary stents placed in 2003 and two additional coronary stents placed two months prior to his admission. He had a history of systolic heart failure with a left ventricle ejection fraction of 20%. In the emergency department atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate was noted with a heart rate of 140. A diltiazem infusion was started and he was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. Repeat echocardiogram several days later showed progressive worsening of his ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 18%. He was started on inotropic support and underwent placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) to assist with hemodynamic stability. Approximately 24 hours later the patient had an episode of melena associated with a drop in his hemoglobin from 10.1 to 7.7. He was started on proton pump inhibitor infusion. He underwent emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed erythema and erosions in the gastric fundus compatible with gastritis as well as grade 1 reflux esophagitis but no evidence of active bleeding. A Helicobacter pylori stool antigen was found to be negative. A colonoscopy was performed after hemodynamic stabilization for further evaluation of melena and pretransplant screen. This was positive for abnormal vascularity, congestion, nodularity, erosions, erythema, and ulceration in the cecum and ascending colon suggestive of ischemic colitis which was later confirmed by biopsy (). Given the unusual involvement of nonwatershed areas such as the cecum and ascending colon, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was performed to evaluate the celiac and mesenteric vasculature. There was no significant narrowing of either vessel noted on the CT; however the inferior metallic marker of the IABP was found to be inferior to the origin of the superior mesenteric artery (). Findings were consistent with ischemic colitis of the cecum and ascending colon as visualized on colonoscopy from occlusion caused by the IABP. The IABP was repositioned"}
{"note": "A 30-year-old woman was admitted to our institution in June 2002 for the treatment of a giant fusiform aneurysm of the basilar trunk. A giant ICA aneurysm had been found during a previous evaluation of abducens nerve palsy on her right side in November 2001 (). At that time, a tortuous basilar artery had been found, but without any aneurysmal dilatation (). She had undergone endovascular trapping of the giant fusiform aneurysm, involving the petrous to cavernous parts of the right ICA, at another hospital (). However, she developed severe headache seven months after the treatment. At the time of admission, she complained of progressive dyspnea, as well as dull headache in the occipital area. Neurologic examination revealed a 6th cranial nerve palsy on the right side and increased deep tendon reflexes in the four extremities. On MR imaging, a giant aneurysm of the basilar artery was found to be compressing the brain stem (). Cerebral angiography showed a fusiform giant aneurysm, with an irregular contour, involving the basilar trunk (). The left anterior inferior cerebellar artery originated just proximal to the basilar trunk aneurysm. In addition, another de novo small paraclinoid aneurysm was found on the left ICA.\nTo relieve the brain stem compression, we decided to obliterate the basilar trunk aneurysm in spite of the risk associated with this intervention. In advance of performing endovascular embolization of the aneurysm, a high-flow bypass from the external carotid artery to the middle cerebral artery was performed using a saphenous vein graft. This is because occlusion of the basilar trunk would have endangered the blood supply to the posterior circulation, leaving the left ICA as the only vessel responsible for the perfusion of the entire brain after the basilar trunk occlusion, since the patient had already undergone occlusion of the right ICA. The bypass supplied the right middle cerebral artery territory (), and an adequate blood supply to the upper portion of the posterior circulation was maintained via the left posterior communicating artery (PCoA). During surgery, part of the occluded right ICA was sectioned"}

Physical examination was done in the emergency department and revealed stable vital signs; the patient was conscious, moving all his limbs; there were warm palpable pulses of the upper arms.\nThe CTA of the aorta revealed a large dissection flap from the origin of the left subclavian artery extending down all the way to the level of renal arteries; there was enlargement of the false lumen at the proximal aorta with large aneurysmal dilatation (mural thrombus) and a compression of the true lumen (ascending aorta). Additionally, there was a large entry point seen 2 cm distal to the right subclavian artery. The aberrant right subclavian artery was noted crossing posterior to the trachea and arising as a last branch of the aortic arch distal to the left subclavian artery; also, the left vertebral artery was arising directly from the aortic arch. There was no other evidence of vascular dissection or occlusion below the level of the renal arteries (Figures and ).\nThe patient underwent general anesthesia for thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) two days after his first day of admission; the procedure was done through the right femoral approach; an angiogram was performed intraoperatively (). Stent graft with a size of 34 mm × 15 cm was used and deployed into the descending thoracic aorta; the intimal entry tear was completely covered by the stent, and the false lumen was obliterated. A postdeployment angiogram revealed successful proximal occlusion of the entry point with no perfusion of the false lumen and good flow through both carotid and left vertebral arteries as well as patent right and left subclavian arteries.\nThe patient was postoperatively moving all his limbs, and the peripheral pulses were intact. He got discharged one day after the surgery and was doing well afterward. We evaluated patient's prognosis"}
{"note": "An 18-year-old male patient (height 140 cm, weight 20 kg) was referred to our hospital for dental treatment under general anesthesia with a chief complaint of an inability to open his mouth wide for dental treatment. The patient was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) at one year of age through muscle biopsy. While he has clear consciousness, he has never walked, as he was unable to move his arms or legs. Since the age of 8, when he suffered aspiration pneumonia, he been completely bedridden and has been using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep. The patient usually has his neck turned to the left because he has difficulty breathing and sometimes experiences signs of dyspnea when he turns his neck to the right. He underwent two rounds of general anesthesia for scoliosis surgery in 2008 and 2010, and had a history of tracheostomy for dyspnea that occurred in the intensive care unit (ICU) after undergoing general anesthesia for the second time. In a limited manner, the patient was able to voluntarily open his mouth and was able to eat regular food. The patient has been complaining of pain in his TMJ and temporal area during mouth opening for 10 years, which hindered him from receiving treatment for long-term molar pain.\nTherefore, he was referred to undergo general anesthesia for treatment of the molar area. However, we decided to defer general anesthesia due to a high risk of respiratory complications based on his medical history and physical examination, and instead performed local anesthesia of his TMJ area. We determined that the patient had severe pain in the bilateral temporal and TMJ area due to hyperextension of the mouth closing muscle while opening his mouth, and perform local anesthesia to alleviate tension in the TMJ and mouth closing muscle area during dental treatment. At the dental clinic, 1 mL 0.5% levobupivacaine was injected on each side of the TMJ and temporalis fascia before performing oral and maxillofacial surgery (). In approximately 10 minutes, the patient reported feeling no pain while opening his"}
{"note": "A 12-year-old female child presented to us initially when she was 5 years old with an episode of generalized convulsion, loss of consciousness and left sided hemiplegia. A non-contrast CT scan done at this time showed a right posterior frontal hematoma. CT angiography did not show any evidence of a vascular malformation. Digital substraction angiography did not show any arteriovenous malformation, though an early draining vein was visualized []. The patient was managed conservatively. The patient presented 1 year after the episode. She had improved in power in her left sided limbs which was now Grade 3-4/5. She was able to walk on her own with little support. A MRI was performed that showed resolution of the hematoma and the presence of a gliotic cavity. A contrast image showed the normal vessels in the region, and there was no evidence of any flow voids in the region of the cavity. MR angiogram performed at the same time also did not show any evidence of an arteriovenous malformation or nidus []. The patient was again observed and asked to follow-up. The patient presented after 4 years, at the age of 9 years, with complaints of intermittent episodes of seizures. A MRI was again repeated which showed the gliotic cavity on T1 weighted scan. On T2 weighted image, some abnormal vessels were seen in the region of the gliotic cavity. MR angiography showed the presence of an arteriovenous malformation fed by the branches of the middle cerebral artery []. A four vessel angiogram was performed which showed an arteriovenous malformation fed by multiple anterior branches of the middle cerebral artery and drained via multiple veins in the superior sagittal sinus. The patient was advised surgery at this time, but since she only had intermittent episodes of seizures the parents were not willing for surgery. One year after this the patient again presented with complaints of intractable seizures. Digital substraction angiography showed the arteriovenous malformation, similar in size and configuration as was seen earlier []. The patient was now operated. The arteriovenous malformation was resected with"}
