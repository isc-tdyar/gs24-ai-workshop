Trans-thoracic echocardiography displayed normal left ventricular size and function with mild degenerative changes of the mitral and aortic valves consistent with age related changes.

There was no laboratory evidence of any metabolic or ischemic etiologies for the conduction disease. Given her age, clinical presentation, underlying conduction disease in the setting of no significant structural abnormalities on echocardiography, and lack of significant comorbidities, the patient likely had age related degenerative conduction disease. Significant coronary artery disease could not be excluded but was very unlikely given the lack of ischemic symptoms and cardiovascular disease risk factors along with normal cardiac size and function. She was arranged to have a permanent pacemaker implant for the symptomatic complete heart block and will have further risk stratification for possible coronary artery disease following the pacemaker implantation.The patient was brought to the operating theater following informed consent. Initial venous access and lead implantation was attempted across the left cephalic vein but aborted due to difficulty in delivering the pacing lead into the right ventricular (RV) cavity; the venous trajectory was that of a persistent left superior vena cava (SVC) draining directly into\n",

      "The patient was a 60-year-old man who referred to our emergency department due to worsening dyspnea and hemoptysis since 2-3 days prior to admission. He reported to have dyspnea and hoarseness during the previous year. He had undergone a direct laryngoscopy which had revealed left vocal cord palsy and a chest computed tomography (CT) scan which had shown a mediastinal mass and with possibility of a malignancy process a direct needle biopsy was done which demonstrated inflammatory cells in the background of blood. His past medical history only included a mild stroke 6 years before without any sequel.\n",
      "At the emergency department he had pulse rate of 86 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18/min and blood pressure of 135/80 mm Hg. He had a continuous murmur in left sternal and pulmonic area and decreased breathing sound in left hemithorax.\n",
      "A chest x-ray was obtained which showed a large density in mediastinum and left sided pleural effusion. In echocardiography he had normal left ventricle but dilated right sided chambers with supravalvular pulmonic stenosis. Trans-esophageal echocardiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm of distal aortic arch with clot formation and compression of the main and left pulmonary artery. As a result a chest CT scan with contrast and angiographic construction was done which confirmed the previous finding of a 45 mm × 37 mm pseudoaneurysm in lateral side of aortic arch distal to left subclavian origin with associated 9.5 cm × 10 cm hematoma in mediastinum ( and ). At this stage and upon further investigation he remembered to have fallen down from a few stairs 10 years ago which did not result in any injuries and accordingly he did not seek medical advice.\n",
      "The patient initially refused operation but a few days later developed severe chest pain and so finally agreed to a surgical plan.\n",
      "The patient had a preoperative selective coronary angiography via right radial artery which was normal. He underwent left thoracotomy via femorofemoral bypass. A large pseudoaneurysm of distal aortic arch was detected (). Large hematoma was evacuated from the mediastinum and the aortic wall\n",
